# scripts/burden_mirror.py
"""Shared writer for the burden mirrors, which hold more than one study.

`convert_burden.py` wrote the whole file. With a second study that stops being
safe: whichever converter ran last would silently delete the other's rows, and
the loss would look exactly like a successful run.

`merge_study` instead replaces only the rows carrying its own `study` value and
leaves every other study's rows alone. That makes each converter idempotent and
order-independent -- a curator can re-run either, in either order, and get the
same file -- which is the property that stops the mirror depending on the
sequence somebody happened to type.

Imported by the per-study converters. Kept out of `src/` because it is curator
tooling: design decision D6 says CI validates, builds and deploys, and never
authors data, so nothing the build imports may depend on this.
