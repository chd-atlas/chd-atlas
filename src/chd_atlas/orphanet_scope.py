"""The rule that admits a syndrome on Orphanet's phenotype frequencies.

Issue #8 part 1, decided 2026-10-24 (spec `2026-10-24-orphanet-scoped-syndromes`):
a syndrome where structural CHD is frequent but not part of the diagnosis is in
scope when a curator nominates it **and** Orphanet annotates a structural heart
phenotype for the disorder it reaches at `Frequent (79-30%)` or stronger. The
curator chooses which terms to put forward; Orphanet's data decides whether each
one qualifies, through a check that can refuse.

Shared by `validate/scope.py` (SCP006/SCP007) and `build/scope.py` (`scope.json`
and the gene-page note), so the check that admits a term and the sentence that
explains it are one reading of one rule, not two.

**Why the restriction to structural phenotypes is the load-bearing part.**
Measured 2026-10-24 over the 8,086 out-of-scope disease terms in the validity
mirrors: with every phenotype under HP:0001627 counted, the Frequent floor
admits 185 terms and 272 genes. With cardiomyopathy and the other
non-malformation branches removed, it admits 132 terms. The difference includes
Fabry disease and Hurler syndrome, which qualify through cardiomyopathy and
valve degeneration rather than a malformation. Even restricted, the rule is not
safe to apply automatically -- HPO's valve branch cannot tell a congenital
malformation from a degenerative one -- which is why it checks nominations
rather than making them.
