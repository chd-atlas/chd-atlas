# src/chd_atlas/build/landing.py
"""`index.html`: the site's front door, and the one page a person opens directly.

Everything else under `build/` is JSON for a program to fetch, or a gene page
`pages.py` renders. Before this module existed the live site measured `200` on
`manifest.json` and `genes/index.json` and `404` on `/` — the data API worked
and nothing told a visitor what they were looking at.

**A doorway, not the census** (2026-10-27). The page says what the atlas is,
states the figures a first-time reader needs, and sends them to the browse
page. It carried 768 words and 17 cards until then, and a reader had to get
through them to reach the genes. What it dropped is stated once elsewhere: the
definitions behind its figures on `methods.html#rare-variants`, the glyph key
beside the glyphs on the browse and gene pages, and the full census in
`manifest.json`'s `counts`.

The document scaffolding is not this module's. `render.document` supplies the
`<!doctype>`, the `<head>`, the navigation, the research-use notice and the one
`<style>` block, so this page shares a single stylesheet with every other page
and makes no request beyond the one that fetched it. What stays here is the
page's content.

Deterministic for the reason every other builder here is. No build timestamp;
every number on the page is read from what `build_site` already assembled —
the corpus, and the same `published`, `validity` and census objects
`build_genes` and `write_manifest` were handed — never hardcoded, so the page
and `manifest.json` cannot state two censuses of one build.

Two of its gene counts read alike and are different claims:

- **Genes published** is `len(published)`, D21's population: the set
  `build_genes` keys `genes/index.json` on, each a gene an external authority
  already treats as a congenital heart disease gene. Counted from the *same
  object*, so the front page and the browse payload cannot differ.
- **Genes the atlas has curated** is the distinct genes named by
  `corpus.assertions` — the genes carrying evidence authored here. Derived once
  and shared with the sentence that names them. Both are shown because nearly
  every published gene carries no assertion at all: a single "genes" figure
  would read as coverage this site does not have.

Every value that reaches the page from curated or mirrored text — a gene
symbol, an HGNC id, an Orphadata header — goes through `html.escape`. None of
it is reviewed the way handwritten page copy is, and a `<` in it is unlikely,
not impossible.

    that reduction, because this page wants only each published gene's
    `admitting_grade`, not the per-gene fields `gene_facts` computes for a
    browse row.

    `published` is the same object `build_genes` keys `genes/index.json` on, for
    the reason that file exists to be counted rather than re-derived: the "Genes
    published" figure on the front page is a claim about that payload, and the
    only way it cannot contradict it is to count the set that produced it. Taken
    as a `Collection` and counted with `len`, which is exact because
    `build_genes` runs first in `build_site` and `Emitter` refuses to write one
    bundle path twice — a `published` carrying a duplicate fails the build there
    rather than inflating a figure here.

    publishes as `counts` — so the front page and `manifest.json` cannot state
    two censuses of one build. It carries no default: a default would let a
    future `build_site` forget to pass one and publish a front page reading
    `0 burden statistics` over a corpus holding 290, on a green build, which is
    this project's characteristic failure exactly.

    `profile_census` is `profiles.profile_census`'s return, the same object
    `write_manifest` publishes as `counts.profile_datasets`/`counts.profile_genes`,
    of which this page states the second — for the identical reason `census` is
    threaded rather than recomputed, and with no default for the identical
    reason: a whole evidence layer has landed
    with this page never touched before (CLAUDE.md section 4.29's burden
