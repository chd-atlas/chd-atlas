# src/chd_atlas/build/pages.py
"""One HTML page per published gene, plus the browse page over all of them.

Everything a gene page shows has been published as JSON since the validity
backbone landed. `genes/HGNC_11604.json` carries seven mirrored validity
records -- four of them with a report URL, and all four render as links --
alongside a curated assertion whose evidence quote, class, strength and
publication this module renders, under a summary of its lesion groups,
inheritance, mechanism and syndromic status (measured 2026-08-04 against a real
build of the committed corpus). All of it sat at a URL, with a verifying
checksum, and with nothing rendering it. This module is what makes that content
reachable by a person rather than only by a program.

It does not make *all* of it reachable, and this paragraph claimed it did until
the claim was measured. On the same real build, `HP:0001631` appears once in
`genes/HGNC_11604.json` and **zero** times in `genes/HGNC_11604.html`; the
evidence locator's `Abstract` likewise, 1 and 0. The assertion's phenotype terms
and the in-text locator on every evidence item reach no page. Rendering them is
a product decision rather than a defect to be patched, so what is recorded here
is only that the JSON, not the page, is the complete artifact.

Written through `Emitter.write_text`, never `write_json`. `Json`'s union
includes `str`, so `write_json(path, page)` type-checks and then runs the whole
document through `json.dumps`, publishing it quoted and escaped as a JSON string
literal. mypy cannot catch that; the mistake is which encoder to call.

**The uncurated sentence is load-bearing.** 118 of the 119 genes published
carry no `LesionAssertion` (measured 2026-10-26 on a real build). Their pages
state that the atlas has not curated them rather than leaving the evidence
section silently absent, because an absent section is indistinguishable from
"the atlas looked and found nothing" and a reader deciding what a gene means
clinically must not have to infer which. Since D55 the sentence is on the card,
in the rail beside the chip, rather than a paragraph in the main column; its
wording must not deny the functional records the atlas may have curated for the
same gene, and `_card_curation` is where that wording and the reason for it are
recorded.

**Neither page kind states a bare grade.** `_SCOPE_SHORT` says in one line whose
classification it is and for what, and links `methods.html#scope`, where the
rule that admits a gene to this site at all and `render.grade_key`'s gloss of
each rung in the grading authority's own words are stated in full (D50,
2026-10-26); and `_graded_diseases` names the disease each
ClinGen panel actually graded -- in the browse table's `graded for` column and in
the gene page's rail, one line under the chip. Both read the same `validity`
mapping the bundles were written from, so the two pages cannot name different
diseases for one gene.

Every value interpolated into a page goes through `render.py`, which escapes
text, links and attributes -- except the bare interpolations in `_rail` (three,
plus its identity block) and in the card helpers it calls, which escape
themselves and say so. Nothing curated or
mirrored is reviewed the way page copy is, and this is the one artifact kind
where a `<` in a disease label is the difference between a string and a script
tag. A mirrored disease label now reaches two more places for that reason: the
rail row and the browse cell, both of which go through `definition_list` and
`data_table` respectively.

The research-use notice is `render.document`'s, not this module's, so it is on
every gene page and on the browse page without either builder mentioning it.

Nothing here reads a clock and every value comes from the caller, so two builds
of one commit render byte-identical pages. `build_gene_pages` iterates its
mapping in sorted order for the reason every other loop in this build does.

# What the published set *is*, in one line, on both page kinds that show it: the
# short form of the scope rule, which lives in full on `methods.html#scope`
# (`methods.SCOPE_RULE`, D50, spec section 5's table) together with the grade
# key. Both page kinds carried the whole rule and the key until 2026-10-26; the
# history of why the rule exists at all moved with it.
#
# What the short form keeps is the half a reader needs on every page, because it
# is the half whose absence did the damage: whose classification this is (an
# external authority's, not the atlas's) and what it is for (the disease it
# names). A green `definitive` under a title reading "CHD Atlas" read as
# definitive for CHD, which measured 2026-08-04 was false for most of the first
# 23 genes.
#
# **It is hedged, because the plain form was false on 53 pages.** The spec's
# short form read "for the disease named, which is not the same as for CHD".
# On 53 of the 119 gene pages the panel graded congenital heart disease itself
# -- ISL1's card reads "definitive for congenital heart disease" one line above
# it (measured 2026-10-26) -- so the sentence denied the card. "Which for many
# genes here is a syndrome rather than CHD" is true on every page: it says what
# the disease often is, not what it is on this one, and the card beside it says
# that.
#
# Both page kinds sit in `genes/`, hence `../`. One constant for both, for the
# reason the full rule was one: two copies of one claim are two things that
# drift.
_SCOPE_SHORT: Final = (
    '<p class="scope-rule">Published on an external authority&#x27;s classification for '
    "the disease it names, which for many genes here is a syndrome rather than CHD. "
    '<a href="../methods.html#scope">How a gene is admitted, and what each grade '
    "means</a>.</p>"
)

# **Two notices, because the sentence was true of 23 genes and is now true of
# 76.** Until 2026-08-06 every published gene carried a ClinGen grade, so "the
# classification above is an expert panel's" was unconditionally true. The
# widened gate admits 16 genes no panel has graded at all -- measured on the
# committed corpus, all 16 shipped that sentence, telling a reader a commercial
# laboratory's submission was a chartered panel's classification, one screen
# below a legend saying no panel had graded it. A sentence's truth conditions
# travel with the population it describes.
#
# `validity_state` is the discriminator rather than `headline_confidence is
# None`, because the two are equal on the committed corpus (16 and 16) and equal
# figures are one figure to every test.
#
# Reworded 2026-10-25 because the validity section became two groups (D51):
# "the classification above is an expert panel's" then sat under the
# "Other curators (GenCC)" table on 59 pages. A sentence's truth conditions
# travel with its position.
#
# **Moved into the card on 2026-10-26 (D55)**, as one sentence each. They were
# two main-column paragraphs, `_NOT_CURATED` ("The atlas has not yet curated a
# lesion assertion for this gene. Each classification above is a ClinGen
# expert panel's or a named curator's ...") and `_NOT_CURATED_UNGRADED`, under
# the validity section; the card states the same claims beside the chip, and
# the main column no longer repeats them. `_card_curation` composes the
# sentence. Two claims had to survive the move, and each is narrower than the
# obvious wording:
#
# * The submitter-admitted sentence keeps its scope. "No ClinGen expert panel
#   has graded this gene" is false unscoped for ACTC1 (Definitive for
#   hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), ELN (Definitive for cutis laxa), FLNA, SMAD6
#   and MNS1 (Disputed for primary ciliary dyskinesia) -- five of the 21
#   admitted on agreement carry a ClinGen record for a disease out of scope,
#   measured 2026-10-26 against `mirrors/clingen_gene_validity.tsv`. Those
#   records reach no page, so the page could not even show the reader the
#   record that contradicted it. The scope clause -- "for any of the diseases
#   in scope here" -- is the grade key's `ungraded` gloss's (`render.GRADE_GLOSS`,
#   on `methods.html#scope`) and the gene index's em-dash sentence's, word for
#   word, so the three scope the claim alike. Only that clause is shared: the
#   rest of each sentence is its own (this one says the submitters
#   "independently assert it", the gloss that they "classify it Limited or
#   better").
# * **"In scope here" names the list, not a property of a disease.** The clause
#   read "for a disease an external authority treats as congenital heart
#   disease, or in which Orphanet records a structural heart malformation in at
#   least 30% of cases" until 2026-10-26, which reads as a sufficient condition
#   and was false on FLNA's card: ClinGen grades FLNA Definitive for
#   periventricular nodular heterotopia (MONDO:0020341), which SCP007 reports
#   would qualify through Orphanet (ORPHA:98892) and which no curator has
#   nominated. A disease is in scope only once it is in
#   `curation/chd_scope.yaml`; `methods.SCOPE_RULE` says how a term gets there.
# * The opening names the lesion assertion as what is absent whenever the
#   atlas has curated functional records for the gene; see `_card_curation`.
# * **"the submitters it is admitted by", not "named above"** (review,
#   2026-10-27). Above this sentence the card named only the `admitted by`
#   row's submitters until R6 put a no-association line between them: on
#   GDF1 it names Illumina, whose `No Known Disease Relationship` asserts
#   nothing, so "the submitters named above independently assert it" took
#   in the one submitter that dissents. The clause now names the admitting
#   submitters by their role, wherever the card puts them.

# Now the matrix's caption, so it is rendered on every page with a matrix rather

# a shared collection alone, and on the 72 pages carrying both PMID:34324492
# and PMID:42230622 the reason is a declared overlap (`Cohort.overlaps_with`,

# order (`_card_rare_variants`, `burden._sort_key`), in which the `damaging`
# union sorts before its components. Measured on a build of 3b766ba: of the 45
# card lines on 32 pages, 15 lead with a different row from their matrix cell,
# on 13 pages. The owner's draft said "its strongest supporting row": the cell
# names a surviving row in a `corrected` cell, ranked by p, not by effect --

# predicate the card's list reads). It rendered with every matrix, 118 pages,

# from; on 55 of those no cell names a row at all (measured on a build of
# ad03128). On the 32 where it renders, card and matrix can lead differently.
# And it claims the card's order only as far as it holds: the card groups a
# study's surviving rows into one line per analysis, ordered by analysis

    the 92 published genes stopped having one: a function that only ever looks
    for definitive records returns nothing for them, and the caller renders an em
    dash beside a `limited` chip -- the disease the panel actually graded silently
    absent from the one row that exists to name it. That is this project's
    characteristic failure in page copy rather than in a join.

    `grade` is `GeneFacts.headline_confidence`, which `derive.gene_facts` derives
    from ClinGen records alone, so what comes back is always the disease behind
    the chip the reader is looking at. `None` -- a gene admitted on GenCC
    agreement, which no panel graded -- returns empty, and the caller names the
    submitters instead.

    A GenCC submitter's own grade is deliberately never here. It admits a gene
    only by agreement with a second submitter (D21) and is never the headline, so
    naming its disease would qualify a chip with a record that did not produce
    it.

    Returns labels rather than MONDO ids: this is the string a reader reads
    beside the grade, and the id is already on the gene page in
    `_validity_section`, which renders both.

    **Sorted, and de-duplicated through a `set` first.** A gene may hold more
    than one record at its headline grade -- two panels grading it for two
    in-scope diseases, or one disease reached through two rows -- and a `set` of
    strings iterates in an order that varies with `PYTHONHASHSEED`, which would
    make the browse page's bytes and therefore its checksum differ between two
    builds of one commit. Measured 2026-08-06 against the committed mirrors: all

    grade, so the multi-label case is latent and its ordering is guarded by

    (`test_a_gene_definitive_for_two_in_scope_diseases_names_both_in_a_fixed_order`).
    That name was wrong here until 2026-08-06 -- it cited a

      lesion group." with the functional-record count appended only when
      non-zero (TBX5 is the one curated gene today, measured 2026-10-26);
    * **not curated, a ClinGen panel holds a record** -- every classification
      on the page is a panel's or a named curator's (97 genes);
    * **not curated, no panel record** -- no ClinGen expert panel has graded
      the gene for any of the diseases in scope here, and it is published
      because the submitters named in the card's `admitted by` row assert it
      (21 genes). Scoped, because unscoped it is false; and scoped to the
      list, because scoped to a property of a disease it was false too; see
      `_CURATION_BY_AGREEMENT`;
    * **functional records but no lesion assertion** (latent: the committed
      corpus has no `curation/functional/` directory) -- appends "The atlas
      has curated N functional record(s)" and opens on "No lesion assertion
      yet curated by the atlas" instead of "Not yet curated by the atlas".

    "Not *yet*" in both openings, because the state is `not_yet_curated`; it
    read "Not curated by the atlas" for one commit.

    **That last opening is the lesson this function inherits.** `atlas_curation`
    is derived from `LesionAssertion`s alone -- `curated` iff `assertion_count >
    0`, `derive.gene_facts` -- while functional records come from a population
    `referential.py` never requires an assertion to cite, so a gene can carry
    curated functional records and still resolve to `NOT_YET_CURATED`. The
    notice this replaced said "not yet curated evidence for this gene ...
    nothing on this page is the atlas's own assessment" until 2026-08-04, beside
    a rail counting `functional records | 3`: denying curated work on the page
    that renders it, this project's characteristic failure in prose instead of
    a dropped join. "Not yet curated by the atlas" followed by "the atlas has
    curated 1 functional record" would be the same defect inside one sentence.
    `atlas_curation`'s meaning is deliberately untouched; what was wrong was
    the sentence, not the field.

    **`validity_state` is the discriminator between the two uncurated
    sentences, not `headline_confidence is None`**, for the reason the notices
    it replaced used it: the two agree on every gene published today (98 and
    21), and equal figures are one figure to every test. They can differ: a
    gene admitted on agreement that ClinGen recorded `No Known Disease
    Relationship` for in scope has a panel record and no headline, and the
    panel sentence stays true of it where "no ClinGen expert panel has graded
    this gene" would not.

    them: "For this gene, the study's S8 Table counts every carrier among its
    CHD cases, so none is an aneurysm proband." The second clause is what
    stops the first reading as a remark on how S8 counts, true of any gene
    (review, 2026-10-27). It is the consequence, not a second figure read off
    S8: the table's bands partition its carriers (measured 2026-10-27, "only
    CHD" plus "only TAA" is "CHD+TAA" for all 528 genes, a blank read as
    none), and of the 10 published genes the line shows, S8's TAA-only `case`
    is 0 for TBX1, EFNB2, SOX7 and ETS1 and blank for the other six -- so the
    sentence never says S8 "counts none" there. It does not retire the
    caveat: the line's denominator is the case set the study analysed,
    aneurysm probands among it (S8 has a TAA-only carrier for 144 of its 528
    genes).

    Where it is fewer, the sentence gives both counts, never "every", and no
    aneurysm count: the mirror carries none, and a difference of two counts is
    not a figure S8 prints. Measured on a build of this tree (2026-10-27): all
    10 published genes with a card line from that study carry the column and
    are equal (ELN, TBX1, GATA4, TAB2, EFNB2, SOX7, ROBO4, ETS1, NKX2-5,
    NR2F2); the one row where it is smaller, ANKRD11's 12 of 13, is on no
    published page, so that form is reachable from a fixture only.

    `rows` are the rows the card's lines show, one per line. The table, and
    the case the second clause rules out, are the ones `CHD_CASE_SPLITS`
    records for the row's study: BUR024 refuses the column on a row of any
    study it does not list, so a row that reaches here without one means the
    gate was bypassed, and that raises rather than names a table the study
    never had. A row with no case carrier says nothing,
    since "every carrier" of none is vacuous. Deduplicated in order, so two
    lines of one study cannot repeat a sentence.

    """The card's rare-variant block: what survives its own study's correction (D56).

    **One line per (study, analysis) with a surviving row**, never one per row:
    KMT2D has five surviving rows over two analyses of one study, and five
    lines in a 15rem column would bury the rest of the card. The line shows the
    group's first surviving row in the table's own reading order
    (`burden._sort_key`, which puts the `damaging` union -- PMID:40127276's
    primary analysis -- before its components), then **names** the group's
    other survivors in the same order: "also surviving: loss-of-function;
    missense (damaging)". It counted them ("2 more survive") until 2026-10-26,
    which beside the `damaging` union counted the union's own components as
    further findings; the union's label already says what it is the union of.
    **Not the "most significant" row**: a line keeps its study table's reading
    order. The evidence matrix's cell is where a row is chosen by p
    (`_matrix_cell`, among the rows behind its state), and its caption says
    the two can lead with different rows (`_MATRIX_LEAD_NOTE`). This read
    "choosing one by p-value would be a ranking, and the atlas authors none
    (D12)" until review (2026-10-27), beside a matrix that chooses by p.
    Groups in study-id order, then analysis label, the order the section's
    own subtitles use.

    "Survives" is `concordance.survives_own_correction`, the predicate the
    evidence matrix's `corrected` tier reads, so the card and the matrix on the
    same page cannot disagree about a row (CLAUDE.md section 4.28).

    **A study that published no correction for this gene gets its own line**,
    whether or not another study's results survive: "<study> publishes no
    corrected p; judge its results against its scan of 138,609 tests in its
    block". Decided per gene, from its rows -- any `pvalue_adjusted` means the
    study published one. PMID:42230622 publishes none on any row and tests 113
    published genes, 24 of them alone (measured 2026-10-26); its block tells a
    reader to judge raw p against its scan ("a Bonferroni threshold over that
    many is p < 3.6e-07"), which SMAD4's p of 2.47e-10 clears. The card read
    "none survives its own study's correction" of it -- a correction that study
    never made. So
    the closing sentence now speaks only of "a correction its study published",
    and the line names the scan size from `Publication.tests_reported` where
    recorded and none where not. No threshold is applied and no statistic
    computed (D12/D33): the reader is pointed at the count the study made.

    Counts in their own unit through `_count`, and a de novo row against its
    expectation through `_controls`, so the card says "24 alleles / 20,151"
    where the table does (D46). A line from a study by an atlas author carries
    `_OWN_LAB_MARK`, as its block carries the declaration.

    **Each result line ends with a link to its study's block** (`_study_anchor`,
    the `id` on that study's `<h3>`): `caveats` where any of the group's
    surviving rows carries a `method_note`, `details` otherwise, with an
    accessible name naming the study (WCAG 2.4.9: the visible word alone does
    not say whose caveats). The counts on a line can need the note to be read
    right -- PMID:34324492's case set includes 777 thoracic aortic aneurysm
    probands, PMID:40127276's case-control arm counts a proband with two
    qualifying variants twice -- and the full note is footnoted in the block;
    only a curated summary of it follows the lines (below). Measured
    2026-10-26: every surviving row of both studies carries one, so all 45
    card lines read `caveats` and `details` is reachable from a
    fixture only. A no-correction line links its study's name instead.

    **Beneath the lines, a study's curated `Publication.summary_caveat`**,
    once per study with a line and in the lines' study order: the one caveat
    the curator says changes what that study's counts mean, so it travels with
    them rather than staying one click away. Measured 2026-10-26: only
    PMID:34324492 carries one (the 777 thoracic aortic aneurysm probands in its
    case set, and a carrier being anyone with a deletion overlapping the
    gene), and it reaches every card that shows its counts.

    With no surviving row it counts the **cohort families** with any row for
    the gene -- independent datasets, never studies, because two papers on one
    sample collection describe the same people -- and, where some study
    published a correction for the gene, says none survives one; where none
    did, it says only how many tested it, and the no-correction lines say the
    rest.

    **That line named no study, so it shed the declaration** (owner decision
    2026-10-26, R7): MYH11, HRAS, KLF13 and CFC1 are tested by PMID:34324492
    alone, nothing survives, and their cards said nothing of its being by an
    atlas author. Where any study that tested the gene is one, the line says
    so: "(a study by an atlas author)" where one study tested it, "(each
    study by an atlas author)" where several did and all are, and "(k of the
    n studies by an atlas author)" where only some are -- counted in studies,
    because the line's own count is of datasets and one family may hold both
    kinds. Measured on a real build: all 86 such lines carry it (24 + 4 of
    the first form, 48 of the second, 7 + 3 of the third). Where a
    no-correction line follows for the same study, it carries the mark too
    (24 cards); each line keeps its own declaration. With no row at all it says no
    study here reports a result, and not that no study *tested* the gene: a
    supplement that omits a gene (CRIPTO, in PMID:42230622) does not say the
    study never ran it. The power caveat follows whenever the gene has rows,
    so "none survives" never stands alone beside a definitive chip.

    **The count carries the front page's qualifier** (owner answer
    2026-10-27), `render.REGISTRY_QUALIFIER`, "(as far as the cohort registry
    records)": the families are joined only through collections the registry
    names or declares overlapping, so this count, like the front page's, sees
    no overlap the registry does not record. It follows the count directly
    and precedes the declaration: placed after it, it would read as
    qualifying who wrote the studies, which the registry does not record at
    all. Measured on a real build the day it was added: all 86 lines carry
    it, in these five forms: "Tested in 1 independent dataset (as far
    as the cohort registry records) (a study by an atlas author)." on 24, the
    same ending "; none survives a correction its study published." on 4,
    "(each study by an atlas author)" on 48, and two datasets with "(1 of the
    2 studies ...)" on 7 and "(2 of the 3 studies ...)" on 3.

    `families` is the corpus-wide grouping `build_site` derives once; a study
    of this gene's rows that no family holds means it was derived over another
    corpus, and the count would be wrong, so that raises rather than renders.

    "Graded for Noonan syndrome as a whole syndrome; in scope because Orphanet
    records a structural heart malformation in at least 30% of cases." A
    syndrome can be in scope on Orphanet's phenotype frequencies
    (`orphanet_scope`), and a grade for it is a grade for the syndrome. The
    validity section's notes say so at length; this says it beside the chip,
    with the reason -- which "Graded for Noonan syndrome, not for heart
    disease", its wording until 2026-10-26, left out.

    **Only when every disease the headline grade is for is Orphanet-scoped**,
    naming all of them, joined with "and" rather than the warrant row's "; ".
    A gene graded at its headline for a syndrome and for a disease an
    authority curated as CHD would read as in scope through Orphanet while it
    is not only that -- 0 of the 98 graded genes today (measured 2026-10-26),
    so the condition is latent and fixture-pinned. And all of them, not the
    admitting record's alone: PTPN11 is Definitive for Noonan syndrome *and*
    Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines. Nothing for a gene no panel
    graded: nothing was graded.

    **A subtype's warrant is its syndrome's** (`Warrant.via == "subtype"`):
    Orphanet records the malformation for Adams-Oliver syndrome, and EOGT's
    Adams-Oliver syndrome 4 is in scope as its subtype -- the one such headline
    among the 21 Orphanet lines measured 2026-10-26. The clause then names the
    Orphanet syndromes the frequency was recorded for, so it is never read as
    a frequency recorded for the subtype itself.

    **A syndrome a ClinGen expert panel scoped gets the line too** (owner
    decision 2026-10-26, R5): "Graded for Holt-Oram syndrome as a whole
    syndrome; in scope on its curation by ClinGen's Syndromic Disorders Gene
    Curation Expert Panel." Ten genes are graded at their headline for such a
    syndrome and their cards said nothing. Which terms are syndromes is the
    curated `ScopeEntry.syndrome` mark, because nothing else says it: ZIC3 and
    NODAL are graded for "congenital heart disease with heterotaxy syndrome",
    which is CHD itself. Rendered only when **every** headline disease is a
    marked term an authority of a ClinGen class scoped, for the reason the
    Orphanet line needs all of them.

    **The reason clause is not the owner's "because <panel> curates it"**,
    which reads as sufficient and is not: measured 2026-10-26 on the ClinGen
    mirror, the Syndromic Disorders panel curates 176 disease terms and 3 are
    in scope, Hearing Loss 63 and 1. What `admitted_by` records, and SCP005
    checks against the mirror, is that the term is listed on that panel's
    curation of it -- so the line says it is in scope *on* that curation. The
    authority is the term's `attributed_to`, verbatim, after "ClinGen's".

    **That panel need not be the one that graded this gene** (review,
    2026-10-27). `attributed_to` names the panel whose curation scopes the
    *term*. EVC2's grade for Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is the Skeletal
    Disorders panel's, and the term is scoped on the Kidney Cystic and
    Ciliopathy Disorders panel's curation of it for EVC; "in scope on its
    curation by" that panel read as the panel having graded EVC2. Where no
    ClinGen record of this gene for the term is that panel's, the clause names
    the genes that panel did grade for it (`panel_graders`, from the validity
    mirror the build already holds): "in scope on ClinGen's <panel>'s curation
    of it for EVC." Measured on a build of 5f7161b: 1 of the 10 lines (EVC2);
    the other nine panels graded the page's own gene. None found is a scope
    term SCP005 refuses, so it raises rather than inventing a gene.

    **Each disease is paired with its own panel.** With two diseases the
    clause sorted the panels apart from the diseases and joined the two lists,
    so Holt-Oram syndrome and TARP syndrome read as curated by the Congenital
    Heart Disease and the Syndromic Disorders panels -- the reverse of the
    terms' attributions. Several diseases now get one "ClinGen's <panel>'s
    curation of <disease>" each, in the order the line names the diseases.
    Latent: every one of the ten lines names one disease.

    line linking the top of `methods.html` as "How to read this page" (P1,
    2026-10-26) beside the gene's JSON. The nav's link to the same file reads
    "How to read this atlas"; from the card the question is about this page.
    Every row from data the page already has -- nothing computed.

    It replaced a definition list of raw tokens and zero counts -- `validity:
    expert_curated`, `atlas curation: not_yet_curated`, `assertions: 0`,
    `functional records: 0`, `curated publications: 0` -- plus a burden-row
    count, which say nothing a clinician can act on and read a measured zero
    where they mean "not curated here". Every one of them is still in the
    gene's JSON. The main column's "not yet curated" notice moved here too, as
    the curation sentence, so the page states it once.

    **The chip class is looked up in `GRADE_CHIP_KIND`, keyed on the grade's own
    value.** Until 2026-08-06 it was `"definitive" if headline is DEFINITIVE else
    ""`, which was right while the gate admitted nothing else and became wrong
    the moment it widened: 53 of the 92 genes published carry `strong`,
    `moderate` or `limited`, and a bare `.chip` renders all three in the same
    grey as `not classified`. A reader cannot tell a panel's weakest supportive
    rung from no panel having looked, which is the distinction the widened gate
    turns on. The definitions are the other half -- the colours are ordinal and
    mean nothing without ClinGen's own words beside them. Since 2026-10-26 (D50)
    the card's gloss line gives the headline rung's, and `render.grade_key` on
    `methods.html#scope`, linked from the page, gives every rung's.

    **The first row's label carries the grade, so the label and the disease
    cannot come apart.** It read `definitive for` unconditionally until the same
    date, and `_graded_diseases` was returning the *definitive* records, so on a
    `limited` gene the row was headed `definitive for` beside a `limited` chip.
    Now the label is the headline's own value -- `limited for: atrial septal
    defect` -- and for a gene no panel graded it becomes `admitted by`, naming
    the submitters whose agreement admitted it. Both come from `fact`, so the
    chip and the row below it are one claim.

    It stays first in the list for the reason the browse column sits beside
    `confidence`: the chip one line above says a bare grade, and on this site's
    title and tagline that reads as "definitive for congenital heart disease".
    For KMT2D it means Kabuki syndrome 1. The row is what stops the chip standing
    alone on the first screen.

    **The gene's identity sits under its symbol (D52)**: approved name, locus,
    MANE Select transcript, and a link row with gnomAD and ClinVar first.
    `external_links` raises for a gene missing the ids those two are keyed on,
    so a page is refused rather than published without them. `identity=None`
    renders none of it; only a caller holding no registry at all passes that,
    and `build_site` always passes one.

      that says whether to believe the two above it. 69 of the 290 published

    -- PMID:42230622 on 87, PMID:34324492 on 61, PMID:40127276 on 25 -- and 13

    the forest fill read. A block saying the atlas added no assessment
    contradicted that page on all 190 own-lab blocks. The sentence says what

    what *rare* meant, and a
    case-control count of rare-inherited variants was indistinguishable from a
    trio's de novo count. `tables.py` states the case against exactly this: the
    partition "exists to stop two incomparable rows from *looking* comparable".

    This said "four" and named `lesion_group` as the fourth until 2026-08-05.
    **`lesion_group` is null on all 290 published rows and always has been** --
    no curated study stratifies by lesion group yet -- so a quarter of the

    schema and a study that uses it should render, at which point that map needs
    filling. Measured, not assumed; the claim it replaces was not.

    Rendered per study rather than per row, from the distinct values across the

    "tested and found nothing" that `FamilyState` has four members for.

    **The guarantee is narrower than an earlier version of this docstring
    claimed.** It said the CNV de novo quadrant "is empty on every page". It is
    on *no* page: `evidence_axes` derives columns from the rows that exist, so a
    design *nobody* ran produces no column at all. What the matrix shows is a
    hole where one family did not run a design another family did; it is silent
    about a design the whole corpus lacks. Measured 2026-08-05: three columns,
    none of them CNV de novo.

    The cell shows the most significant of the rows that give it its state

    the supporting rows of a `nominal` one -- ordered by corrected p where
    published and by raw p otherwise, tie-broken on
    `(consequence_class, cohort_stratum)` so the choice is deterministic across

    137 panels printed it with no hollow marker drawn, across 10 genes --
    CHD7, GATA4, KMT2D, MYH7, NKX2-5, NODAL, RBFOX2, RNF40, WDR5, ZIC3, six
    of them ClinGen `definitive` -- and on 9 of those the panel did draw
    arrows, so the key told the reader that everything visible had failed a
    correction. Every other clause measured 0 captioned-but-not-drawn.

    **And there was no clause for a filled mark at all**, so its meaning had
    to be inferred as the complement of the hollow one. That inference was
    wrong for all 205 arrows on the site until `_mark_class` began deciding
    an arrow's fill; it is stated now rather than left to be worked out.
    The filled clause excludes a surviving *synonymous* row, which is drawn
    muted rather than in the result colour and has its own clause below.

    **The axis clause was wrong in a different way: it named a mark that is
    on the panel and then said the wrong thing about it.** The measure label
    was already dynamic; the gloss beside it was the literal "no enrichment"
    for every measure, so 112 of the 137 panels told the reader that 1 on an
    odds-ratio axis means no enrichment. Both halves now resolve from the same
    token -- see `_NULL_LINE_GLOSS` for the measurement and the third
    vocabulary. The sibling `<title>` on the same figure had always varied
    correctly, which is why reading the panel did not show it.

    **The survived-but-hollow clause (2026-10-26)** renders only where a
    non-synonymous row cleared its study's correction without supporting the
    gene (`_survived_against_the_gene`), which `_mark_class` draws hollow --
    no published panel today. The hollow clause's "did not survive" is false
    of that row, so the hollow clause renders only for the other hollow rows
    and the new clause stands on its own where that row is the panel's only
    one.

    **The union clause is conditional twice**: once on a union being shown as
    one at all, and once more on whether every tagged row is fully split.
    Measured 2026-08-20: 10 panels tag a row with only one of its two
    components drawn, TBX5's Audain odds-ratio panel among them, and the key
    told the reader to reconcile it against a row that is not there.

    The pooling clause is **not** conditional, and it is worded as policy
    rather than as an observation about this page. It is here at all because
    the forest idiom ends in a summary diamond and a reader who knows the
    idiom will look for one; its absence has to be an answer rather than a
    gap. It deliberately does not reuse `_POOLING_NOTICE`'s own sentence:
    that constant is the matrix's caption, and a test asserts it survives
    outside the fold, which a second copy of its wording here would satisfy on
    its behalf.

    edge nobody stated -- asserting exactly the boundary that field exists to
    refuse, and asserting it in the one encoding a reader takes at a glance
    rather than reads. `heart_looping` is the live case: the source states
    when it begins and never when it ends.

    ids alone rather than of the stage walk that found them, so it does not
    move when a dataset's stage list does. The two orders are genuinely
    different: dropping the sort changed 85 gene pages and the manifest, and
    reversing this dataset's 21 stages reorders the unsorted one while leaving

    """What the picture cannot say about itself, in words beside it.

    Four things a reader would otherwise have to guess, and two of them are
    traps. The horizontal axis is stage *order*, not elapsed time, so the gap
    between 13 and 16 wpc is drawn the same width as the gap between 4 and 5.
    Saying so is the difference between an ordinal axis and a false linear
    one.

    **And the vertical axis is fitted to this gene alone**, which is the
    second trap and the one that was unstated. Every gene's curve fills the
    same 104 px whatever it spans: measured 2026-08-20, PKD1L1 runs 1 to 2
    tpm in heart and TBX20 runs 1 to 526, and the two were drawn as the same
    full-height excursion under a caption that named neither number. The
    range is printed here for the reason `_spark_caption` prints its own --
    a shared axis and a per-gene one are different claims, and a reader can
    only tell which they are looking at if the figure says.

    **Both break clauses are conditional on the break being in this figure.**
    The tick clause was not, and it named a mark most pages do not draw:
    measured 2026-08-20, all 85 trajectory pages said "the stage is ticked on
    the axis instead" while **55 drew zero ticks**, and 55 of the 59 with a
    visibly broken line were among them -- TBX5 has two polylines, a visible
    gap, and the only sentence about gaps described a mark that is not there.

    **And the second cause was never named at all.** A line also breaks where
    this dataset has no row for that organ at that stage, which for
    E-MTAB-6814 is the same set of stages for every gene (heart has none at
    `school age child` or `elderly`, forebrain none at 6 wpc, testis none at
    `neonate` or `school age child`). `_tissue_medians`' docstring insists
    that state and a below-floor one "must not render the same way", and in
    the picture they did.

    **It is stated as the axis's range, never as the medians'**, and the two
    differ on exactly the genes where the wording matters most. `_axis_bounds`
    widens a flat series by half a decade either side, because `LogScale`
    refuses a zero-span axis; 3 of the 85 charted genes are flat (TFAP2B and
    MMP21 at 1 tpm, FOXH1 at 2), and "median abundance in heart, 0.316 to
    3.16 tpm" would attribute to their medians a spread neither end of
    which anyone measured.

    **One visible line, and the rest behind a toggle (D57, 2026-10-26).** The
    caption was one paragraph of four or five sentences, 108 to 151 words,
    under the trajectory on 112 pages; the visible line is 61 on every one of
    them (measured on builds of 0fc451a and of this change, as the
    whitespace-separated words of the rendered text: tags stripped, entities
    unescaped). The gene-page budget's tokeniser, which drops a token with no
    letter, digit, τ or ∞ (a bare dash), reads 107 to 149 and 60. The two axis
    sentences stay in sight: they say what every point on the figure is, and
    the second is particular to this gene. The floor, tick and no-row clauses
    and the shaded phases fold under "How to read this chart", which closes on
    a link to `methods.html#expression`, where the axes are stated once in
    general; the link reads "How to read expression figures", for the reason
    the forest's names its section rather than the nav's "How to read this
    atlas". **The fold changed no clause's condition.**

    **The floor clause came back out of the fold (owner decision 2026-10-26,
    E1)**, in a short form on the visible line and only where it fires. It is
    particular to this gene -- a tick is drawn because a stage of this organ
    reads below the floor -- and measured on a build of 3b766ba it fired on 32
    of the 112 trajectory pages, inside the toggle on every one. The owner's
    draft said "Ticks under the axis"; a tick is a `marker` centred on the axis
    line, so it says "on the axis", and it keeps "beneath the foot of the
    scale rather than at a value on it", which stops a reader reading a tick as
    a measurement. The no-row clause's first spelling read "different again" while the floor
    clause sat before it in this paragraph; it reads "different" now, a
    contrast with the tick the visible line has just explained.

    USP44, DAW1, FGF8, GDF1, NODAL. Their headline grades are `definitive`
    (ZIC3, NODAL), `moderate` (DAW1, FGF8), `limited` (USP44) and none at all
    (SEMA3E, GDF1). They are laterality and outflow-tract genes acting in rare
    lineages, which is exactly the dilution `methods.html#expression` states
    in full. `_BULK_TISSUE_NOTICE`, the line above every dataset block, has
    said nothing of dilution since 2026-10-26 (bulk tissue, and a low figure
    is not evidence the gene is unimportant, then the link), so on these
    pages this sentence is the only statement of the mechanism: measured on a
    build of 802d694, "diluted" appears on 7 gene pages, these seven, once
    each, all in this sentence. An empty chart beside a definitive chip
    asserts the thing that caveat denies, so this tier states the fact and
    the mechanism rather than showing a frame with nothing in it.

    **Two branches, because "nothing placed" is not one fact.** All seven of

    argument; a cell left unplaced because no percentile grid was published,

    figure it did publish is in the table below regardless.

    stages carry no τ) with only the figure changing. Per-organ axes would
    rescale each line to its own range and draw five similar-looking traces,
    which is the same non-answer in a picture.

    One axis is what makes a τ of 0.80 to 1.00 -- TBX5's range across those 19
    stages -- legible as a place rather than a number. Measured 2026-08-20 on
    the committed corpus: TBX5's heart medians run 5 to 275 tpm, and the four
    non-heart organs it places anything in peak at forebrain 2, ovary 3,
    testis 4 and liver 12, so heart's peak sits 22.9x -- 1.36 decades -- above
    the highest of them. **Not "above everything else": heart's own minimum,
    5 tpm at middle adult, is below liver's 12.** The panels are what shows
    that, and seven private axes would show none of it. TBX5 draws five of
    them; hindbrain and kidney place nothing and the caption names them.

    `data-scale-high` is emitted from the axis itself rather than recomputed,
    so a build that gave each organ its own scale would publish a different
    value per panel and could not pass the test asserting they are equal.
    Assert the property, never the appearance.

    **What earns this under D43** -- never a panel redundant with the source's
    own browser -- is `Dataset.cardiac_tissues`. Which organ counts as cardiac
    is this atlas's own declaration in `curation/datasets.yaml`, not the
    source's; the source's browser has the per-organ curves and makes no such
    claim. The caption states that in words, because a stroke weight is not an
    argument.

    Returns `""` in the two cases where a panel would assert more than the
    data does, D42's rule that a page says so rather than drawing an empty
    frame:

    - **No stage reports a τ at all.** τ needs at least two organs, and with
      one sampled there is no specificity to draw a specificity panel about.
      `_SPECIFICITY_GAP_CLAUSE` is what the page says instead, once per stage,
      and it says it already.
    - **No organ has a single placed median.** Nothing to plot.

    **Only medians this dataset placed are drawn**, which is `_tissue_medians`'
    discipline reused rather than restated: a below-floor figure is one this
    atlas declines to vouch for, and putting it on the same line as ones it
    does is the conflation `_percentile_cell` refuses in words. The line
    therefore breaks at an unplaced stage exactly as `_trajectory`'s does --
    measured 2026-08-20, 20 of the 85 charted genes have a below-floor stage
    strictly between two plotted points, and a guard added to one layer is not
    a guard.

    An organ with nothing placed gets no panel and is **named in the caption**
    instead. Silently dropping it would leave five panels beside a τ sentence
    reading "7 organs sampled", the page contradicting itself, and a reader
    concluding this dataset never looked there.

    Four things, and three of them are traps. The horizontal axis is stage
    *order* rather than elapsed time, exactly as `_band_caption` says of the
    trajectory. The vertical axis is **shared**, which is the entire claim the
    figure makes and the one a reader cannot check by looking. The highlighted
    organ is this atlas's own declaration and not the source's, which is what
    admits the panel under D43. And an organ with no panel was still sampled.

    **The opening clause said "one panel per organ this dataset sampled for
    this gene", and 25 of the 91 pages carrying it went on to say "No panel is
    drawn for ..." three sentences later.** A page that corrects itself is not
    a page that is right: the first sentence is what a reader takes the grid
    to mean, and an organ dropped for having nothing placed is exactly the
    organ they would otherwise conclude was never looked at. It now says what
    the grid actually is -- one panel per organ with a *placed* measurement --
    so the sentence naming the dropped organs adds to it rather than
    contradicting it.

    **A line breaks for two reasons and only one was named.** The caption
    attributed every gap to the detection floor; a panel's line also breaks
    where this dataset has no row for that organ at that stage, and in a
    spark there is no tick, so the two are pixel-for-pixel identical.
    Measured 2026-08-20 on the built corpus: 87 of the 92 genes have at least
    one panel split by a no-row stage -- testis on 82 pages, heart on 72,
    forebrain on 69. Each cause is now its own clause, conditional on
    occurring in this gene's panels, which is `_line_breaks`' whole purpose.

    **The cardiac clause has three positions and no blank one.** A panel where
    the declared cardiac tissue has nothing placed carries no highlight, and
    "Highlighted: heart" beside no highlighted panel is false -- a sentence's
    truth conditions travel with its position (`_POOLING_NOTICE`'s recorded
    lesson). Measured 2026-08-20 on the committed corpus, that is 6 of the 91
    genes with a panel, so it is a live case. It names the declaration anyway,
    because "this atlas calls heart the cardiac tissue and placed nothing
    there" is the fact, and dropping the sentence would leave a reader to
    conclude the atlas never declared one.

    **One visible line, and the rest behind a toggle (D57, 2026-10-26).** The
    caption was one paragraph of five or six sentences, 133 to 175 words,
    under the grid on 118 pages; the visible line is 41 on every one of them
    (measured on builds of 0fc451a and of this change, as the
    whitespace-separated words of the rendered text: tags stripped, entities
    unescaped). The gene-page budget's tokeniser, which drops a token with no
    letter, digit, τ or ∞ (a bare dash), reads 131 to 174 and 40. What stays in sight
    is what every panel is: one per organ with a placed measurement, in stage
    order, all on one abundance axis whose range is printed. Why the axis is
    shared, the highlight, the breaks and the organs with no panel fold under
    "How to read this chart" (`_chart_notes`, the trajectory's toggle too).
    The fold changed no clause's condition. The opening clause stays the one
    the paragraph above explains: it is true of a grid that drops an organ, so
    the folded sentence naming the dropped organ adds to it rather than
    correcting it.

    organ sampled, then every figure.

    Two pictures, answering two questions, and neither substitutes for the
    other. `_trajectory` reads one cardiac organ in detail across development;
    `_small_multiples` compares every organ on one shared axis, which is what
    τ asserts once per stage and nothing on the page showed. Each returns `""`
    on its own terms, so a dataset can carry either, both or neither.

    The link is D39(b)'s other half reaching a reader rather than only a
    program: `build_profile_quantiles` publishes the 101-point grid a
    percentile above was read against, and this is the one place a person
    reading the page -- not a script reading the bundle -- can reach it.
    Omitted when `quantile_shard` is `None` (a corpus mid-curation, or the
    gate bypassed) rather than linking a file `Emitter` never wrote.

    `dataset` is looked up by the caller and may be `None` --
    `ProfileGap.DATASET_NOT_REGISTERED` is a real, named state, not a caller
    error, so this degrades to no cardiac tissues and no floor rather than
    raising: the gap is already stated on every cell it affects, and this
    function's job is to render what the payload says, not to police a
    registration mismatch a validator already reports elsewhere.

    **The stage blocks move into a `<details>`; they do not leave.** This
    section rendered 21 near-identical blocks per dataset, one per stage, and
    59% of its text was verbatim repetition -- "below the detection floor in
    whole liver at this stage (detection floor 1 tpm)" appeared 20 times on
    the TBX5 page.

    **A bare percentage is not reproducible, so here is the method that
    produced that one.** Build `dev`, take the TBX5 page from
    `<h2>Developmental expression</h2>` to the end, replace every tag with a
    newline (which puts each table cell on its own line), strip and drop
    blanks, and count the words in lines that duplicate an earlier line:
    1,854 of 3,136 words over 513 lines, 146 of them distinct -- 59.1%. Other
    ways of asking the same page give very different answers, none of them
    wrong: 12% of its characters sit inside a repeated *sentence*, and 89% of
    its tokens sit inside a repeated 4-gram. The figure is about *lines*, and
    the lines are mostly table cells.

    A chart that *replaced* them would take every exact figure out of the
    HTML, which is this repository's characteristic defect (curated work
    reaching no page) wearing a redesign. The summary is what a reader sees

    the idiom of the lesion-assertion notice (now the card's curation sentence,

    `datasets` resolves each entry's own accession to the curated `Dataset` it

    `facts` is `build_genes`' return, so the pages render from the same
    derivation the bundles were written from rather than deriving it twice --
    a page and its bundle disagreeing about a gene's confidence is the failure
    this shared input removes.

    `symbols` is the same `{gene: labels.symbol}` projection `build_genes` and
    `build_landing` take; a gene absent from it reads as its own HGNC id, the
    same registry fallback those two apply.

    `identities` is `identity.read_gene_identities`' return (D52). Given a mapping,
    every gene must carry the ids its required links are keyed on: a gene
    absent from it gets `EMPTY_IDENTITY`, which `external_links` refuses. `None`
    renders no identity block at all -- the unit suites that do not exercise
    identity pass nothing -- and `build_site` always passes the registry.

    A gene absent from `validity` gets `uncurated()` -- the section under its own
    heading, each authority group stating it holds no record, never a missing
    section.

    `profiles` and `datasets` both default to `None` -- and to `{}` inside --
    rather than to `{}` in the signature, the same reason `concordance` on
    `build_gene_index_page` does: an empty *literal* dict default is one object
    shared across every call that omits the argument, which is harmless only as
    long as nobody ever mutates it, and this project does not rely on that
    holding forever. A gene absent from `profiles` gets `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_
    PROFILE`, matching `bundles._expression_profile`'s own fallback exactly, so
    the page and the bundle cannot disagree about which genes carry a
    developmental expression profile. `datasets` resolves an entry's own
    accession to the curated record `_expression_section` reads
    `cardiac_tissues` and `detection_floor` from; see that function's docstring
    for why a missing dataset degrades rather than raises.

    `phases` is the same `CardiacPhaseFile` the profiles were derived against,
    threaded down rather than re-read, so a band on a chart and the phase
    sentence under the stage it covers cannot name different vocabularies.
    `None` -- no curated phase file at all -- costs the trajectory, not the
    section: `_trajectory` refuses to draw an unbanded curve, because a curve
    with no band is the panel the source's own browser already publishes, and
    every figure it would have summarised is in the tables regardless.

    Sorted, like every loop in this build that iterates a mapping: `sort_keys`
    orders dict keys in a JSON payload and has nothing to say about the order
    files are written in, and a differing write order would move nothing here
    today but is the habit this project keeps.

    publishes as `burden_row_count`. The browse page did not mention burden at
    all -- no column, no filter, no count -- while the payload behind it did, so
    a reader scanning 23 identical `definitive` rows could not tell that four of
    them (ISL1, NR2F2, RBM10, SMAD2) carry no loss-of-function evidence at all.
    Raised by review 2026-08-05 and measured on the built site.

    Every row is rendered here, by the build. The inline script only *hides*
    rows, so the page is complete to `curl`, to a crawler, and to a reader with
    JavaScript disabled -- the alternative, an empty `<tbody>` populated from
    `genes/index.json` at runtime, looks identical in a browser and serves
    nothing to any of the three.

    Sorted by HGNC id, the order `genes/index.json` publishes in, so the browse
    page and the payload behind it agree on which gene comes first without
    either reading the other.

    **The attribution line is not decoration.** This page renders 23 rows
    reading `definitive` under a column headed `confidence` (measured
    2026-08-04), and it was the only page on the site where that could be read
    as the atlas's own call: `_validity_section` says "Every classification
    below is an upstream panel's or submitter's" on each gene page, and
    `landing.py` says "The atlas authors no validity classification of its own"
    on the front page. The sentence below says the same thing in the same voice,
    and names `atlas curation` as the column that answers the question the
    confidence column does not -- whether the atlas has curated the gene at all.

    **Whose call it is was only half of it.** All 23 of those rows read
    `definitive` with no disease anywhere on the page, and the scope rule
    (`_SCOPE_SHORT` here since D50, in full on `methods.html#scope`) plus the
    `graded for` column are the other half: a row reading `KMT2D | definitive` on
    a site titled "CHD Atlas" claims KMT2D is definitive for congenital heart
    disease, and ClinGen's actual assertion is `KMT2D -- Definitive for Kabuki
    syndrome 1`, made by the SCID-CID GCEP. `validity` is taken for that column
    alone; `facts` carries no disease, and deriving one from a second read of the
    mirrors would let this page and the gene page it links to name different
    diseases for the same gene.

    Since the gate widened the column answers a second question too. An empty
    `confidence` -- rendered as an em dash, like every empty cell here -- now
    means something specific: no ClinGen panel graded the gene, which is why
    `_graded_diseases` returns nothing for it either, and that pair of dashes is
    the only one on this table that is not a gap in the data. The paragraph
    under the heading says so (it said "a blank confidence" until 2026-10-26),
    and `render.grade_key` glosses it on `methods.html#scope`, which both page
    kinds link from their short form (it was a folded key on both pages until
    2026-10-26, D50).

    **A contested gene is not shown as settled here either.** Until 2026-10-26
    the confidence cell was the bare grade, so BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1, PTPN11, RAF1
    and SOS1 read as ordinary `definitive` rows while `genes/index.json` behind
    this page flagged each `has_conflicting_evidence` -- the reading
    `docs/data-api.md` tells a client never to commit. The cell now carries the
    gene card's own `conflicting evidence` chip, wherever the flag is set;
    `data-confidence` stays the bare grade, because the facet matches it.
    `test_every_contested_gene_is_chipped_on_the_gene_index_and_no_other_is`
    holds it against a real build.

    Two couplings to `render.FILTER_SCRIPT` that nothing in the type system
    holds, both pinned by
    `test_every_facet_names_a_data_attribute_the_filter_script_reads`:

    * each `<select>`'s `name` is resolved into an attribute by concatenation,
      `row.getAttribute('data-' + select.name)`, so the four names below must
      spell the four `attributes` keys exactly. A mismatch reads `null` and
      hides every row the moment that facet is used, while the page looks
      correct until someone touches it.
    * the script matches a facet with `.split(' ').indexOf(want)`, so a value
      carrying a space could never be selected. None can: measured 2026-08-04,
      no member of `LesionGroup`, `Classification`, `ValidityState` or
      `AtlasCuration` contains one. That is what lets `data-lesion` hold a whole
      space-joined list and still match a single group.

    Every `<option>` value comes from a vocabulary member -- an enum in
    `vocab.py`, not a curated or mirrored string -- so nothing reaches the
    `selects` markup below unescaped. Everything else on the page goes through
    `render.py`, which escapes cells and attributes itself.

    # Sorted for the reason every other set-derived sequence in this build is:
    # a `set` of strings iterates in an order that varies with PYTHONHASHSEED,
    # and the option order is part of the page's bytes and therefore its
    # checksum.
    # `aria-label` on every control, because the only other thing naming any of
    # them is its own first option ("any lesion") or, for the search box, a
    # placeholder. Neither is a label: a placeholder is announced inconsistently
    # and disappears the moment a character is typed, and a `<select>`'s first
    # option describes the *current value*, not what the control filters. A
    # reader on a screen reader would meet five unlabelled controls. Raised by
    # review on #14; the labels are literals here rather than derived from
    # `label` so that "any lesion" stays the neutral option text while the
    # control is announced as what it does.
    # `html.escape` on the option value, though every value is a vocabulary
    # member. Review on #15 measured this as the one interpolation on the whole
    # site where escaping was decided by provenance rather than by `render.py`:
    # driving this loop with a value of `"><script>alert(1)</script>` emits a
    # live `<script>` element into the page while the same build's table cells
    # stay correctly escaped. The provenance argument holds today -- all 21
    # members of `LesionGroup`, `Classification`, `ValidityState` and
    # `AtlasCuration` are `[a-z_]` -- and an invariant that rests on nobody ever
    # adding a member with a quote in it is not one this project keeps.
