# src/chd_atlas/build/burden.py
"""Per-gene rare-variant burden, loaded from `mirrors/burden.tsv`.

Loading and grouping only. The bundle shape is `burden_payload`'s and the page
markup is `pages._burden_section`'s, the same split `omics.py` has with
`bundles.py`: this module knows the mirror, and nothing here knows HTML.

**Nothing filters a row out.** Not the synonymous rows, which are the study's own
negative control and the reason this layer is worth publishing at all; not the
rows with no case carrier, which are evidence *against* enrichment; not the rows
whose odds ratio came back unbounded, which carry the strongest signals in the
data. A gene's rows reach the page exactly as the study computed them, and the
page's job is to label them, not to choose between them.

The one thing that is *not* published is anything this atlas computed. There is
no pooled p-value across studies and no per-gene summary verdict, because the
CHD literature reuses cohorts -- DDD contributed to more than one CHD exome
study, though only one cited today names it (`curation/cohorts.yaml`) -- so a pooled
statistic would count the same children twice. `shared_cohorts` is the
alternative: it names the overlap instead of pretending it away, and it
derives nothing beyond a set intersection over what each study already declared.

    127 genes publish no page (CLAUDE.md section 10 records that asymmetry as
    intended, so re-mirroring is not needed the day D21 widens). A front page
    counting the mirror would advertise 1,475 statistics a reader cannot reach
    from any link on it, and `manifest.json` would promise a consumer five times
    the rows it can fetch. It counts the rows that reach a published bundle --
    290 that day.

    **`families` is the dataset count, never `len({row.study for row in rows})`.**
    A cohort family is a connected component over shared sample collections, so
    two papers drawing on one collection describe the same people and count once
    (`concordance.cohort_families`). The two were equal over the committed
    corpus — three studies citing disjoint collections — which is precisely why
    they were separated here and separated again in the tests. They parted on
    owner decision 2026-10-27 (I3): DECIPHER and DDD are declared overlapping
    (`Cohort.overlaps_with`), so PMID:34324492 and PMID:42230622 are one family
    and the census reads 2 families for 3 studies. Taken as a parameter rather than
    recomputed, so this page and the strip on every browse row count the same
    families.

    Genes are counted as those with at least one *published* row rather than as
    `len(published)`. They were equal at 23 of 23 when this was written, and
    stating the published-gene count under a burden label would have kept
    reading as 23 on the day a gene was published with no burden evidence at
    all -- which has since happened: they differ by every published gene no
    rare-variant study covered.

    **`families` is the one figure here NOT restricted to `published`, and that
    asymmetry is deliberate.** `rows` and `genes` count what a reader can reach;
    `families` counts the cohort families in the corpus, including any whose
    studies tested no published gene. Restricting it would be worse, not better:
    a family exists because two studies share a sample collection, and dropping
    a member because none of its genes cleared the publication gate can split
    one family into what then presents as two independent datasets -- inventing
    independence D33 exists to deny. So the front page can state a family count
    one higher than the number of families any published gene was tested by.
    Reviewed 2026-08-06 and kept; the alternative was measured and inverts a
    real overlap.

    **`studies` is restricted to `published`, like `rows`** (owner decision
    2026-10-26, R7): the front page says how many of the rare-variant studies
    whose results the site publishes are by an author of this atlas, and a
    study whose rows all sit outside the gate has no block on any page to say
    so. Sorted, because it is derived from a set.

    **`surviving_genes` counts the published genes whose card lists a
    result** (owner decision 2026-10-26, R9): a gene with at least one row
    `survives` passes. `survives` is `concordance.survives_own_correction`,
    the predicate the card's list reads (`pages._card_rare_variants` groups
    exactly the rows it passes, with no exclusion of its own), handed in by
    the caller rather than imported, because `concordance` imports this
    module; required, so no caller can count by a rule of its own. Measured on
    a real build the day it was written: 32 of the 118 genes with a published
    row, and every one of the 32 cards lists a line.

    enrolled in childhood. Measured 2026-08-05: no cohort description reached a
    single published byte. The curator wrote the caveat, the model documented
    where it goes, and no reader could reach it.

    A cohort absent from the registry keeps its id as its label at the render
    site -- the same fallback `build_genes` applies to a gene missing from
    `mirrors/genes.tsv`. `validate_burden_references` reports the absence as
    BUR009 and the gate refuses on it, so that fallback is unreachable behind

    """Publish `cohorts.json`: the table a bare cohort id resolves against.

    **Every burden row names its collections by bare id and nothing mapped those
    ids to anything.** Measured 2026-08-06 over the published corpus: 13 distinct
    ids appear across 915 rows -- `taa_cases`, `gnomad_controls`, `ukbb` and ten
    more -- and `curation/cohorts.yaml` reached zero published bytes, so every
    programmatic consumer got the numbers without the caveats that qualify them.
    `Cohort.url` reached no byte at all. The descriptions rendered only inside a
    `<details>` on the gene page, which is a fact about the HTML and not about
    the API.

    The caveats are the point, not decoration. `taa_cases` is 777 sporadic
    thoracic aortic aneurysm probands, a condition **outside this atlas's
    scope**, in a case set the study reports as CHD (whether any of them also
    has a congenital heart lesion is recorded nowhere this atlas has read);
    `ukbb`'s controls are adults recruited at 40-69 against cases a substantial
    proportion of whom were enrolled in childhood; `ddd` ascertains on developmental disorder, so
    its contribution is enriched for syndromic CHD. A consumer computing anything
    from a row without those sentences is computing something else.

    **The whole registry is published, not only the ids the published rows
    cite.** The two sets were identical when measured -- 20 and 20 on
    2026-10-27 -- and identical figures are one figure to every test (CLAUDE.md
    section 4.30), so this says which one it is: this is a *resolution table*,
    and a table that omitted an id
    some row cites would 404 exactly where a reader needed it. The direction is
    also the safe one -- `validate_burden_references` (BUR009) already refuses a
    row citing a cohort this file does not carry, so publishing the registry
    entire means every id in every row resolves by construction, while
    publishing the cited subset would make that guarantee depend on the gate.

    Sorted by id: `encode_json`'s `sort_keys` orders dict keys and never list
    elements, so an unsorted array here checksums differently between two builds
    of one commit. `url` is emitted as `null` rather than omitted where a
    collection has no public page (11 of the 20 on 2026-10-27), because an
    object whose shape varies is a trap for a consumer reading a field off one
    record and expecting it on the next -- the rule `admission_provenance` and
    `burden_payload` already follow. `review_status` and `review_note` follow
    it too: both `null` on a record no open question is recorded for.
