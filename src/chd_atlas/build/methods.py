"""`methods.html`, "How to read this atlas": site-wide explanation, written once.

D50. Every gene page repeated the same explanation -- the rule that admits a
gene, the grade key and, in later sections, the reading notes for the validity,
rare-variant and expression evidence -- so a reader met the same paragraphs on
every page and the part particular to the gene was buried under them. This page
holds that explanation once; each gene page keeps a short form and a link to the
section here that states it in full.

**Every sentence below the introduction either was moved off a gene page, the
gene index or the front page, or was written here to state in full what a gene page now says in
one line or prints without defining -- and each was read in this position.** A
sentence's truth conditions travel with its position (CLAUDE.md section 4.27):
"the table below" was true on a gene page, false on the gene index and false
here, and "this page" here names a page with no gene on it.

* `#scope` was moved: the scope rule and the grade key. Those that were false
  here were reworded -- the scope rule's last clause, and the grade key's
  dispute and completeness sentences. The rest are unchanged because they are
  true anywhere: the key's opening sentences, and the rung glosses
  (`render.GRADE_GLOSS`), which stay verbatim on purpose because a gene page's
  card glosses its headline grade from the same constant, and one rung must not
  be glossed two ways.
* `#validity` was written new (2026-10-26). Its gene-page sentences did not
  leave: the ClinGen-copy notice stays on the page (P5), and the table's intro
  keeps a short form of its scope. The section states in full what those
  abbreviate, for a page with no table on it -- so "a gene page lists", never
  "listed here" or "the panel record above". Its third paragraph states in
  full what the card's two warning chips abbreviate to two words each.
* `#curated-evidence` was written new (2026-10-26, owner decision E3): what
  a curated gene's two extra sections hold -- the atlas's own lesion
  assertions and the publications their evidence cites -- which no page
  explained while every card's "How to read this page" linked here. Each
  clause was read off `models/assertion.py`, `pages._evidence_section`,
  `derive.gene_facts` and `validity.published_genes`; it names no count, so
  nothing in it expires when a second gene is curated.
* `#rare-variants` opens with the front page's two definitions, moved here with
  the doorway page (2026-10-27). After them it is both: three paragraphs moved
  off every gene page (the folded reading notes and the composite note's
  second sentence), and two are the full forms of notices a gene page keeps in
  one line. Two more state in
  general what each forest plot's folded key says of its own marks (D57), and
  what a block with no effect measure shows instead of a plot; one more, what
  the `all cases` case group is, which a forest key says in one clause
  (2026-10-26).
* `#cohorts` is curated data under one written paragraph: every record of
  `curation/cohorts.yaml`, the same ones `cohorts.json` publishes. A gene page
  keeps the notes of its own cohorts, folded, and links here (P4).
* `#expression` is both (2026-10-26): two paragraphs moved off the gene pages
  (the folded reading notes: the placement note from every page with data,
  the comparability notice from every page that laid out more than one
  placement), one is the full form of the bulk-tissue notice a gene page
  keeps in one line, and one states in general the chart axes each chart's
  visible caption line states of its own figure (D57). Two more define what
  the pages print and nothing defined (review, 2026-10-26): tau, and the
  developmental phases each stage names and each trajectory shades.

`tests/unit/test_build_methods.py` pins the scope rule and the key's opening
paragraph against literals, sliced to the section; the glosses by a phrase
unique to each, as one label-chip-gloss triple per rung; `#validity`,
`#rare-variants`, `#expression` and, on a fixture registry, `#cohorts` whole, as
literals; the cohort intro's figures against the mirror and the committed
registry; the bulk-tissue claim, and the dataset the floor sentence names,
against the curated datasets; and the phrases the move retired as absent from
the whole page, built with no cohorts and with the committed registry.
`tests/test_built_site_is_consumable.py` checks `#cohorts` against the
`cohorts.json` of a real build.

Written through `Emitter.write_text`, for the reason `pages.py` gives: `Json`'s
union includes `str`, so `write_json` would type-check and publish the page as a
quoted JSON string. Nothing here reads a clock or iterates a set, so two builds
of one commit write the same bytes.

# What the published set *is*, stated in full here and in one line on both page
# kinds that show it (`pages._SCOPE_SHORT`, which links this section).
#
# No page on this site said it. `docs/data-api.md` states the rule and a reader
# of the HTML never sees it, so a browse page of 23 rows all reading
# `definitive`, under a title reading "CHD Atlas" and a tagline about congenital
# heart disease, said "these 23 genes are definitive for CHD". Measured
# 2026-08-04 against the committed mirrors, that was false for most of them: 10
# of the 23 were qualified by a panel that is not the Congenital Heart Disease
# GCEP -- SCID-CID for KMT2D and KDM6A, Hearing Loss for CHD7, Kidney Cystic and
# Ciliopathy Disorders for NOTCH2 and EVC, Intellectual Disability and Autism
# for ZEB2, Skeletal Disorders for EVC2, Syndromic Disorders for TBX5 and
# TFAP2B, Prenatal for FLT4 -- and 10 were definitive for a disease whose label
# names no cardiac feature at all (Kabuki syndrome 1 and 2, Mowat-Wilson,
# CHARGE, Alagille, Ellis-van Creveld twice, Holt-Oram, TARP, and NR2F2-related
# multiple congenital anomalies).
#
# The 2026-08-06 widening makes the sentence carry more, not less. Measured on
# the widened corpus: 92 genes, of which 76 are admitted by a ClinGen record at
# or above `Limited` and 16 by two or more GenCC submitters with no ClinGen
# record at all. A reader meeting `limited` needs to know both that a chartered
# panel wrote it and that this atlas did not.
#
# Moved from `pages._SCOPE_RULE` (2026-10-26, D50), where it was one constant
# for both page kinds. Its last clause said the disease "is shown beside the
# gene", true on a gene page and on the gene index and unanchored here, so it
# now names both places -- and says "for a gene a ClinGen panel graded", since
# the 21 genes admitted on submitter agreement have no panel-named disease to
# show (their card names the submitters instead).
#
# Its first part was rewritten on 2026-10-26, after review measured it false
# read as a rule (each measured that day on the committed mirrors and the
# pinned HPO release):
#
# * It named a *property of a disease* where the code reads a *list*. A disease
#   is in scope only once it is in `curation/chd_scope.yaml`, on either path:
#   SCP007 reports 239 unnominated terms that would qualify on Orphanet's
#   frequencies (FLNA's periventricular nodular heterotopia among them), and
#   Orphanet's own GenCC submissions name Ebstein anomaly (MONDO:0009144),
#   which is not a scope term. So the sentence says what a term needs to be
#   listed, and that a qualifying disease is not in scope until it is.
# * "independently assert it" was weaker than the gate, which counts a GenCC
#   submitter only at `Limited` or better (`validity.agreeing_records`).
# * "Structural heart malformation" is now defined, from
#   `orphanet_scope.structural_phenotypes` -- and two clauses are narrower
#   than the text this was drafted from. The excluded branches are named as
#   *excluded*, not as all the branches that are not malformations: the kept
#   ones still hold aortic valve calcification, mitral valve prolapse and left
#   ventricular hypertrophy, and the sentence says so. And a subtype qualifies
#   on its syndrome's frequency (`Warrant.via == "subtype"`), which the
#   parenthesis states. `test_the_structural_set_the_build_applies_is_the_one_
#   methods_html_states` (`test_orphanet_scope.py`) ties every term named here
#   to the set the build computes, so changing the rule where this names it
#   fails there until this is reworded.
#
# Widened by owner decision 2026-10-26 (R1): pulmonic stenosis, aortic valve
# stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, truncus arteriosus, an interrupted
# aortic arch and anomalous pulmonary venous return joined coarctation and the
# ductus (`orphanet_scope.ADDED_BRANCHES`), so the clause that named three of
# them "not counted" now lists all eight. Two clauses are narrower than the
# owner's preview, each measured that day on the pinned release: the set still
# leaves lesions out -- peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (HP:0004969) and an
# aortopulmonary window (HP:0011604) are filed elsewhere and not added -- so the
# sentence names two rather than implying every lesion now counts; and aortic
# valve stenosis is not always a malformation, which the sentence says beside
# the calcified valve.

    "Limited or better for one and no ClinGen panel disputes it. A disease is in scope when "
    "it is one of the terms this atlas lists, and a term is listed only if an external "

    "and <strong>Orphanet records a structural heart malformation in at least 30% of its "
    "cases</strong> (for a subtype, of the syndrome it belongs to); a disease that would "
    "qualify is not in scope until it is listed. Here a structural heart malformation is a "

    "page names the authority that admitted the gene. A classification is not the same "

# How a gene page's validity table is listed (2026-10-26, D50). The page's own
# intro states the short form -- only in-scope records are listed -- and links
# here. The copy sentence describes `pages._repeats_the_panel` and is copied
# from `docs/data-api.md`'s account of it, read against the function that day:
# a copy is hidden only on a match on disease, mapped grade, inheritance and
# calendar date, and a copy with no date matches nothing.
#
# Two clauses are narrower than the text this was drafted from, each measured
# 2026-10-26 on the committed mirrors and a real build:
#
# * "Each gene's JSON keeps every record" read, beside the next paragraph's
#   "that record is not shown", as though the JSON held the out-of-scope
#   records. It holds none -- 591 bundle records, 0 for a disease outside
#   scope -- and all 121 copies, so it says "every copy".
# * "a gene page is not every classification the gene has" was false for 43 of
#   the 119 published genes, which have no ClinGen or GenCC record for any
#   disease outside scope. "may not be", as the gene page says.
#
# Reworded after review the same day. It opened "Every classification in this
# atlas is an upstream panel's or submitter's, republished with its provenance
# intact", which the grade key's first sentence already says two paragraphs up;
# it is said once, there. "the ClinGen expert panel's own records" became
# "ClinGen expert panels'", and "A panel may have classified" became "A panel or
# submitter": the scope filter drops GenCC rows too, and most out-of-scope
# records are GenCC's (76 published genes have one, 27 an out-of-scope ClinGen
# record).
#
# The third paragraph glosses the card's two flags (2026-10-26), which no page
# explained: `methods.html` mentioned "sources disagree" zero times, and on all
# six pages carrying it ClinGen and GenCC agree on every gene-disease pair they
# both classify. Each clause is read off the code that sets the flag:
# `vocab.has_conflicting_evidence` over every in-scope record with a mapped
# classification (`derive.gene_facts`), and `validity._has_source_discordance`,
# whose sources are `ValiditySource.CLINGEN` and `ValiditySource.GENCC` -- so a
# ClinGen copy submitted to GenCC is GenCC's there. `NO_KNOWN_ASSOCIATION` is
# subtracted from the supporting side and is not in `CONTESTED`; `Supportive`
# maps to no classification and is read by neither. The flag is per gene by the
# owner's decision (2026-10-25), so the paragraph says what that permits rather
# than narrowing it. "Narrower" is exact: a gene with `has_source_discordance`
# has a contesting and a supporting record, which is `has_conflicting_evidence`.

# What a curated gene's page adds (owner decision 2026-10-26, E3). A gene page
# renders "Curated evidence" and "Publications" only for a gene with a lesion
# assertion (`pages._evidence_section`, gated on `AtlasCuration.CURATED`), and
# this page explained every other section but those two. Each clause read off
# the code that day:
#
# * An assertion is `LesionAssertion`: a curator's record that the gene belongs
#   to one or more lesion groups (`lesion_groups`, at least one), with
#   `inheritance`, `mechanism` and `syndromic` (isolated, syndromic or both) --
#   the four rows the page's definition list renders.
# * Each `Evidence` item cites exactly one publication (`publication`, a
#   required PMID) and carries `evidence_class`, `strength` (strong, moderate,
#   supporting or contradictory) and the curator's own `summary` -- the
#   table's four columns. The owner's draft said "quoted evidence": `summary`
#   is the curator's summary, not a quotation, and the record locates the
#   passage instead (`locator`), which the page does not render.
# * It changes nothing mirrored, and that is D37: `validity.published_genes`
#   reads the validity records alone, and `derive.gene_facts` headlines the
#   strongest ClinGen record whatever the assertions say; an assertion feeds
#   only `lesion_groups` and the curation fields.
# * "Publications" lists the distinct publications the evidence cites, sorted,
#   with their id, title and year (`_CITATION_HEADERS`), and renders exactly
#   where "Curated evidence" does. Named as a curated gene's page's own: it
#   read "The Publications section that follows" until review (2026-10-27),
#   and on this page what follows is the rare-variant section.

# How to read a gene page's rare-variant section (2026-10-26, D50). The page
# keeps a one-line short form of the two paragraphs after the front page's
# definitions (`pages._MIRRORED_NOTICE` and `pages._POOLING_NOTICE`) and links
# here; the three after those were the page's folded reading notes and its
# composite note's second sentence, and left it.
#
# Narrower than the text this was drafted from, each measured 2026-10-26 on a
# real build of 4233eca:
#
# * "Every count and statistic in a gene page's rare-variant section" -> "in a
#   gene page's study tables". The evidence matrix in that section shows tallies
#   the atlas derives -- "n = N" in a cell on 86 pages, "N rows" on 48 -- and
#   each PMID:42230622 block carries the atlas's own Bonferroni arithmetic
#   (`0.05 / 138,609`); neither is an upstream study's number.
# * "republished exactly as published" -> "as published". The tables round to
#   three significant figures: 376 of the 1,210 published raw p-values render
#   rounded (PMID:40127276's 0.00583259259259259 reads 0.00583). Each gene's
#   JSON carries them in full.
# * The units sentence said `cases` and `controls` "each show observed / total".
#   On a row tested against a mutation model the `controls` cell is the model's
#   expected count (`pages._controls`, which keys on the comparator): 108 cells
#   on 36 pages read "0.0358 expected" and the like. It says so.
#
# Reworded after review the same day: "children" -> "people", because
# `shared_cohorts` counts shared control collections too and a control cohort
# may be adults (UK Biobank's note: "~500,000 UK adults recruited at ages
# 40-69"); the overlap clause says what the page can know -- collections shared
# *as this atlas has recorded them* -- since `shared_cohorts` sees only shared
# registry ids and declared overlaps, and two studies may share individuals no
# entry names (review raised DDD and DECIPHER, which the registry has declared
# overlapping since owner decision 2026-10-27, I3); the synonymous paragraph
# lost "the same uncorrected scale" (true of the one study that publishes a

# How to read a gene page's developmental expression section (2026-10-26, D50,
# D57). The page keeps a one-line short form of the first paragraph
# (`pages._BULK_TISSUE_NOTICE`, one of the ten caveats the spec keeps
# visible) and links here; the next two were its folded "How to read these
# figures" notes, and left it; the next two define tau and the developmental
# phases, which the pages print and nothing defined (review, the same day, each
# recorded where it is written); the last states in general the axes each
# chart's visible caption line states of its own figure, and is where every
# chart's "How to read this chart" toggle links (`pages._chart_notes`).
#
# Each was re-read for a page with no gene, dataset or figure on it, and read
# against the code and a build of 0fc451a that day. Narrower or different from
# the text this was drafted from:
#
# * The bulk claim names *developmental* expression: the profile datasets the
#   gene page's section renders, all `bulk_rnaseq` today (E-MTAB-6814 alone).
#   Unconditional by design, it reads no data, so
#   `test_every_curated_dataset_is_the_bulk_tissue_the_expression_notes_say`
#   holds it to the curation instead -- every curated dataset, whatever its
#   design, since review (2026-10-26). Its "the detection floor" was "a
#   dataset's" for one revision and is "the" again since review (2026-10-26):
#   "a dataset's" read as the source's, and the second paragraph now says
#   whose a floor is.
# * "Each organ's median abundance" had a gene in view; it is "a gene's median
#   abundance in an organ". "the number of genes measured" is the number the
#   grid was built from (`Placement.n_genes`, 58,735 in every cell of
#   E-MTAB-6814's grid), and it travels with every percentile "a gene page
#   shows" -- "shown below" named nothing here. Measured: all 11,331
#   percentiles on the 119 pages are stage-table cells reading "N of 58,735
#   genes".
# * "a dataset's own detection floor" read as the source's, and the one floor
#   in the corpus is this atlas's curated choice (E-MTAB-6814's `floor_source`:
#   "Curated, not mirrored: the Expression Atlas declares no threshold for this
#   experiment"). Dropping "own" did not fix that -- "its dataset's" still
#   credits the floor to the dataset, which a reader takes for the source's,
#   and no HTML page said otherwise (review, 2026-10-26). So the paragraph now
#   says it: a floor is a threshold this atlas records per dataset, not
#   necessarily its source's; E-MTAB-6814 is named as a dataset whose source
#   declares none; and `datasets.json`, which publishes `detection_floor` and
#   `floor_source` for every dataset, is linked for the value and its basis.
#   "every developmental dataset's record" holds by construction: a
#   developmental dataset here is a profile one, as in the bulk claim above,
#   and a profile dataset declares both fields or does not load
#   (`Dataset.a_profile_dataset_is_fully_declared`). No number: a floor is per
#   dataset, and the record carries it. No percentile is published below it: `profiles.placement`
#   returns `None` for a median under the floor, the bundle publishes that
#   `null`, and `percentile_annotations` skips it for the omics preview.
# * The comparability sentence was conditional on a page laying out more than
#   one placement (118 of 119 did); stated once in general it has no position
#   to be false in. "on this page" became "in this atlas" and "elsewhere on
#   this page" "for another". "as the heart matures" became "over development",
#   because every organ's grid moves, not the heart's alone: liver's 90th
#   percentile is 24 tpm at 4 wpc and 5 at adolescence, heart's 28 and 6.
# * The axes sentence was checked against `_even_x` (both charts space a
#   dataset's stages evenly, in `Stage.order`), `_small_multiples` (one
#   `LogScale` per dataset block, over every organ drawn) and `_trajectory`
#   (one chart per declared cardiac organ, its axis `_axis_bounds` over that
#   organ's placed medians). "share one abundance axis" is "within a dataset":
#   a second dataset's grid would draw its own.

# list joined it on 2026-10-26. It names only sections the page renders, so the
# expression clause joined it only with `#expression` (2026-10-26) -- it was
# removed once for promising a section the page did not yet hold. "the
# rare-variant studies draw on" became "the rare-variant results name" the same
# day, for the reason `_COHORTS_INTRO` records: the list is what the rows name,
# not all a study drew on. The curated-evidence clause joined it with
# `#curated-evidence` (E3), in gene-page order.
