"""Symbol-to-id resolution, checked. Issue #33: report, never drop.

`GEN000` follows `REF000`/`SRC000`/`ONT000`/`SCP000`: when the registry cannot
be read, say "checks skipped" once instead of reporting every symbol in the
corpus as unresolvable. A missing reference table must never present as hundreds
of dangling references -- that buries the real error under cascading false
positives, and distinguishing "the data is wrong" from "the reference data never
loaded" is one of this project's two load-bearing guarantees.

`GEN004` (owner decision 2026-10-26, R13) is the registry's other job: the
Ensembl and NCBI Gene ids every published gene page links by, held to the rule
the build refuses a page on (`build/identity.py::identity_id_problems`).

    `labelled` is `(hgnc_id, symbol, where)` -- what a validity mirror already
    carries in both columns, so this is a *self-consistency* check on data that
    is already keyed correctly rather than a join.

    **GEN003 exists because the registry goes stale and nothing else notices,
    and its first finding was not staleness at all.** From 2026-08-06 to
    2026-08-24 it stood on HGNC:1152: `mirrors/genes.tsv` recorded `POPDC1`
    with aliases `POP1|HBVES` while ClinGen labelled the same gene `BVES`, and
    `BVES` was not among those aliases (`HBVES` is a different string). The
    mirror was **current**. `BVES` is HGNC:1152's *previous* symbol, the
    converter read `alias_symbol` and nothing else, and the mirror had no
    column to hold a retired name -- so the recorded remedy, "regenerate the
    registry", reproduced the same row byte-for-byte and the warning survived
    every refresh. It cleared when `prev_symbols` and this module's third
    resolution tier landed, not when anyone re-ran the converter.

    Kept, because the failure mode it was written for is real and now
    reachable: a mirror that genuinely lags upstream. A symbol-keyed source
    naming a symbol the registry cannot resolve would drop the gene silently,
    which is the exact failure #33 exists to prevent. Design decision D6 keeps
    regeneration a human action rather than something a build does, so this
    reports and stops.

    A symbol resolving to a *different* gene is the serious case and is reported
    the same way rather than more loudly, because it is not reachable from a
    correct mirror: both columns come from the same upstream row. It is here so

    2026-10-26 on a copy of the committed corpus, TBX5's Ensembl id cut to
    `ENSG0089225` validated with 0 errors and the build refused the repository
    after writing had begun (a missing NCBI Gene id behaved the same). The

    disagree; the population is the build's too, the published genes, so a
    registry row for a gene the gate does not admit is not this check's
    business. A published gene with no registry row at all lacks both ids.

    ERROR, because the build refuses on it. A validator reports and never
    raises. `identities` is `build.identity.read_gene_identities`' return, the

    missing an id column, which TBL008 or TBL001 reports as an error, so this
    returns nothing rather than one GEN004 per published gene.

    **An empty mapping is not `None`, and is one GEN004** (review,
    2026-10-27). A header-only `mirrors/genes.tsv` reads, as no rows, and
    neither TBL008 nor TBL001 fires on it. The caller passed `or None` to
    spare the report one error per published gene, which switched the check
    off: measured on a copy with TBX5's assertion moved out (so no REF001
    either), validate reported 0 errors and the build raised from
    `external_links` after writing had begun. So an empty registry with
