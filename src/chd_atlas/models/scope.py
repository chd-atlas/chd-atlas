"""What counts as congenital heart disease for this atlas.

This file is the answer to "why is this gene here?", and it exists because
neither obvious mechanical rule works. Measured 2026-08-03 against the committed
ClinGen mirror: filtering on the Congenital Heart Disease expert panel drops
TBX5 (curated by Syndromic Disorders), NOTCH1 (Hereditary Cardiovascular
Disease), CHD7 (Hearing Loss), KMT2D and KDM6A (SCID-CID), FLT4 (Prenatal), ELN
and CTNND1 (Craniofacial) -- every one of them classified Definitive. Filtering
by MONDO `is_a` closure fails from the other side: verified against EBI OLS4,
Holt-Oram syndrome (MONDO:0007732) has 31 hierarchical ancestors and
MONDO:0005453 "congenital heart disease" is not among them. It descends from
MONDO:0005267 "heart disorder", which also subsumes cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia
and acquired disease -- so the closure wide enough to catch Holt-Oram stops
meaning CHD.

Scope is therefore a *selection* among terms external authorities already use --
never a judgement authored here. Until 2026-08-06 every entry in this file named
the project owner as the admitting authority, which made this atlas the
authority on what counts as congenital heart disease. It is not one, and the
owner said so in as many words: *"I am not a clinician... We should take a
reputed source that already do this work for us."* No individual's name belongs
in this file.

So `admitted_by` is now a closed vocabulary of **external** authorities and a
person's name is not representable in it. `attributed_to` names the specific
panel or submitter, and `validate/scope.py` checks that authority actually uses
the term in a mirror -- so the attribution is measured rather than asserted.
Measured 2026-08-06 across the 68 committed terms: 13 are used by ClinGen's
Congenital Heart Disease GCEP, 10 by another ClinGen expert panel, 45 by GenCC
submitters, and **0 by no authority at all**. Every term already had an external
warrant; only the field recording it was wrong.

**A second path since 2026-10-25 (issue #8 part 1):** `ORPHANET_PHENOTYPE_FREQUENCY`,
for syndromes where structural CHD is frequent but not part of the diagnosis. Its
warrant is Orphanet's own frequency annotation, checked by SCP006 against the
mirrors (`orphanet_scope.py`). Measured 2026-10-25 across the 105 committed terms:
13 ClinGen CHD panel, 11 other ClinGen panel (NOTCH1-related AOS spectrum disorder
joined, under the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease panel), 45 GenCC submitter, and
36 Orphanet frequency.

    """Who treats a disease term as congenital heart disease. Never this atlas.

    **A closed vocabulary precisely so a curator's name cannot be entered.** The
    previous field was free text and held one curator's name on all 68 terms; an
    enum makes that unrepresentable rather than discouraged, the same reason
    `PUBLICATION_FLOOR` is a rank floor rather than a set of admissible rungs.

    Ordered strongest first. `CLINGEN_CHD_PANEL` is ClinGen's chartered
    Congenital Heart Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel using the term itself --
    the closest thing to an authority purpose-built for this question.
    `CLINGEN_EXPERT_PANEL` is another chartered ClinGen panel, which matters
    because the syndromic CHD genes are curated there: TBX5 by Syndromic
    Disorders, CHD7 by Hearing Loss, KDM6A and KMT2D by SCID-CID.
    `GENCC_SUBMITTER` is a body submitting through GenCC -- an aggregator, so
    `attributed_to` must name the submitter and never GenCC itself.

    `ORPHANET_PHENOTYPE_FREQUENCY` (added 2026-10-25, issue #8 part 1) is the one
    class whose warrant is a *frequency* rather than a curation. Orphanet does
    not curate a syndrome as CHD; it records how often a structural heart
    phenotype occurs in it, and `orphanet_scope.py` admits the syndrome when
    that is `Frequent (79-30%)` or stronger. It is for syndromes where CHD is
    common but not part of the diagnosis -- Noonan, Costello, Adams-Oliver --
    and it requires `ScopeEntry.orphanet`, which SCP006 checks against the
    mirrors.
