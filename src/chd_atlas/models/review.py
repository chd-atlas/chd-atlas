"""An open question a curated record carries, stated rather than settled.

The owner's standing rule (answer of 2026-10-27, "from now on"): where a curated
record rests on a source that conflicts with the paper it cites, or on a source
that could not be read, the record says so. It carries a status naming which,
and a short note stating exactly what is unresolved. It never asserts either
side, never speculates about which is right, and is never dropped: dropping
the record would hide the question along with it.

**The vocabulary is wider than the rule that introduced it.** The same answer
marked two scope terms `pending_review` for a question that is not about
sources at all: whether each names a syndrome, left open for clinical review.
So the one definition, which `docs/data-api.md`, the manifest's changelog and
both curated files' headers repeat (the review of 2026-10-27 found the API
doc, the changelog and `chd_scope.yaml` defining it by a source conflict
alone, which is false for the two terms):

* `pending_review` -- a question about the record that this atlas leaves open
  for an expert. On the two cohorts marked today, the sources it rests on
  conflict; on the two scope terms, it is a clinical judgement.
* `not_accessible` -- a source the record rests on could not be read.

**One vocabulary for every record kind that carries one**, so "pending review"
means the same thing on a cohort as on a scope term, and a consumer reads one
token set. Today that is `Cohort` and `ScopeEntry`; each declares the two
fields itself and calls `check_review` from its own validator.

Absent means no open question has been recorded, not that the record was
checked and found clean.
