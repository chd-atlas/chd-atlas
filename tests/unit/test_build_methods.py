    * **Both warrants, or the sentence describes a gate the site does not
      have.** Stating only the ClinGen half would tell a reader that every gene
      here was graded by an expert panel; 21 of the 119 were not (measured
      2026-10-26), and they are the ones whose provenance most needs stating.
    * **The negative is the load-bearing half.** The rule used to say a gene is
      definitive "for a disease in this atlas's CHD scope", which told 24
      published pages that this atlas decides what counts as congenital heart
      disease. It does not; scope is a selection among terms external
      authorities already use. Without the negative a future edit could
      restore the old sentence beside the new one and satisfy every positive.
    * **Sliced to the section, because page-wide the fragments could not
      fail.** The grade key's `ungraded` gloss carries "two or more Gene
      Curation Coalition submitters classify it Limited or better" in the same
      section's `<dl>`, so the slice is the rule's own `<p>`: rewriting the
      rule to state a **one**-submitter gate survived all 796 tests when the
      check was page-wide (measured 2026-08-06, CLAUDE.md section 4.19).

    Its last clause said the disease "is shown beside the gene", true on a gene
    page and on the gene index and unanchored here, so it now names both
    places -- and only for a gene a ClinGen panel graded: the 21 genes admitted
    on submitter agreement have no panel-named disease to show (2026-10-26).
    The full literal pins the wording; the fragments beside it are the
    claims any rewording must keep, so a deliberate edit to the literal is not
    also a silent edit to the gate it describes.

    **Its first part names a list, never a property of a disease**
    (2026-10-26). It read "for a disease that an external authority treats as
    congenital heart disease (or in which Orphanet records a structural heart
    malformation in at least 30% of cases)", which reads as a sufficient
    condition the build does not apply: SCP007 listed 239 unnominated terms
    that would qualify on Orphanet's frequencies, FLNA's periventricular
    nodular heterotopia among them, and Orphanet's own GenCC submissions name
    Ebstein anomaly, which is not a scope term. So the fragments now include
    what a term needs to be listed and that a qualifying disease is not in
    scope until it is; the retired clause is asserted absent from the whole
    page by `test_no_sentence_the_move_retired_comes_back_here`. Its ontology
    clauses are held to the set the build computes by

    GenCC copies are listed, and what is not shown at all.

    The copy sentence describes `pages._repeats_the_panel`, read 2026-10-26: a
    copy is hidden only when a panel record matches it on disease, mapped grade,
    inheritance (in the page's vocabulary) and calendar date, and a copy with no
    date matches nothing -- so it is listed where any of the four differs, where
    it has no date, or where there is no panel record to match.

    * "Each gene's JSON keeps every record" read, beside the next paragraph's
      "that record is not shown", as though the JSON held the out-of-scope
      records. It holds none: 591 bundle records, 0 for a disease outside
      scope (`validity.gene_validity` drops them before a gene is keyed). It
      does hold every copy -- all 121 -- so it now says that.

    **Reworded after review, 2026-10-26.** Its opening sentence ("Every
    classification in this atlas is an upstream panel's or submitter's,
    republished with its provenance intact") repeated the grade key's first
    sentence two paragraphs up, so it is written once, in the key. "the

    `sources disagree` rendered on six pages with no title and was mentioned 0
    times on this page, and on all six ClinGen and GenCC agree on every
    gene-disease pair they both classify: the flag is per gene, by the owner's
    decision, and fires because one source disputes the gene for one disease
    while the other supports it for another. Each clause is read off the code

    """The rare-variant reading notes, moved off every gene page (2026-10-26, D50).

    Eight paragraphs, each pinned whole. The first two are the full forms of the
    two notices a gene page keeps in one line (`pages._MIRRORED_NOTICE`, which
    links here, and `pages._POOLING_NOTICE`); the next two were the page's folded
    "How to read these numbers" notes; the fifth was the second sentence of its
    composite note; the sixth says what `all cases` is; the last two are below.
    Each was re-read for a page with no table on it: "In each study's table"
    anchors what the units sentence describes, and "the rows above it" became
    "beside it".

    Recorded decisions that moved with them:

    * **The absent-cell sentence must not say why a row is absent.** Moved from
      `test_the_section_says_what_a_missing_row_means_without_asserting_why`.
      Until 2026-08-05 it asserted "no variant of that class was seen in either
      group" -- measured over PMID:42230622 alone, and false for the other two
      studies: PMID:34324492 tests one consequence class by construction, and
      PMID:40127276 observed 14,364 synonymous variants (its Dataset S4) and
      published no synonymous row. That phrase is asserted absent from this page
      by `test_no_sentence_the_move_retired_comes_back_here`, and from the gene
      page by `test_the_general_reading_notes_are_on_methods_html_and_not_on_the_gene_page`.
    * **The negative control carries its own condition.** Moved from
      `test_the_synonymous_negative_control_is_explained_only_where_one_exists`.
      On a gene page it rendered only where a synonymous row did, because 2 of
      the 3 studies publish none (every synonymous row is PMID:42230622's); here
      it is stated once, with that condition in its own words ("Only a study
      that publishes one has it").
    * **The pooling paragraph is policy, in the present tense about nothing.**
      "these cohorts overlap" sent a one-study page's reader hunting for a
      second study; it is asserted absent here too.

    **Three clauses are narrower than the plan's text, each measured 2026-10-26
    on a real build of 4233eca** (`methods._RARE_VARIANTS` records the detail):
    "in a gene page's rare-variant section" became "in a gene page's study
    tables", because the evidence matrix in that section shows tallies the atlas
    derives ("n = N" on 86 pages, "N rows" on 48); "republished exactly as
    published" lost "exactly", because 376 of the 1,210 published raw p-values
    render rounded to three significant figures; and the units sentence says
    what `controls` shows on a row tested against a mutation model, because 108
    such cells on 36 pages read "N expected", not observed / total.

    **Reworded after review, the same day.** "children" became "people": a
    shared collection may be an adult control cohort. The overlap clause says
    what the page can know -- collections its studies share *as this atlas has
    recorded them* -- because `shared_cohorts` sees only shared registered ids,
    and two studies may share individuals no record names. The synonymous
    paragraph lost "the same uncorrected scale" (true of one study, stated in
    general) and "a scan of that size" (no antecedent here). The units
    parenthesis keys on what `pages._controls` keys on: the comparator, not the
    variant's origin.

    **Pinned whole, not paragraph by paragraph.** A `re.findall(r"<p>...")`
    over the section skips any `<p class=...>` or `<details>` appended to it:
    measured in review, a composite note, a disclosure and a "How to read these
    numbers" fold appended to this section all passed.

    **Two paragraphs were added with the forest key's fold (2026-10-26,
    D57)**: the key each forest plot now folds behind "How to read this
    chart", stated once in general, and what a block with no effect measure
    shows instead of a plot. Every mark clause was measured against a real
    build of 9f24190 before it was written in general: all 29 right arrows
    are odds ratios with 0 control carriers and a published lower bound; all
    257 left arrows have 0 case carriers; every plotted study either corrects
    every row or none. One clause is narrower than the plan's text: "contains
    other rows in the same panel" was false for 10 union-tagged rows, on 10
    panels, that contain exactly one other drawn row -- "at least one other
    row", as each panel's own key says.

    **Three changes after review (2026-10-26).** The composite paragraph
    explained `damaging` and nothing said what the `all cases` case group is,
    though a forest key says it in one clause; the sixth paragraph does, in
    general, and `test_an_all_cases_row_is_the_union_of_the_case_groups_its_
    study_splits` holds it to the mirror. "these have none" had no antecedent
    nearer than "a forest plot", so it names this atlas's. And the muted row was
    singular, while every panel that draws one draws three -- one synonymous row
    per case group, 113 panels on a real build -- so it is "one of a study's
    synonymous rows".

    **One sentence added the same day**, when a marker's fill began reading
    `concordance.survives_own_correction` for every row but a synonymous one:
    a depleted row that cleared its correction is drawn hollow, and "a hollow
    marker is a row that did not" survive is false of it. Latent: 0 published
    rows are in that state.

    **Two clauses narrowed after a later review (2026-10-26).** That sentence
    said "a row", and a synonymous row that survived its correction is drawn
    filled and muted, not hollow, so it says "a non-synonymous row". And the
    case-group paragraph called an unsplit study's `all cases` its "whole case
    set", a denominator equivalence no study's rows bear out (PMID:34324492's
    count 6,746 of its 7,958 cases); it now says only that the group is not a
    subgroup, and the old phrase is asserted absent.

    **The first paragraph states the one rule the atlas applies** (owner
    decision 2026-10-26, W2). It said the atlas "adds no assessment" of the
    studies' numbers, while the card, the matrix and the forest fill each
    decide what survives by `concordance.survives_own_correction`: not
    synonymous, a raw p below 0.05 and a result pointing to enrichment in
    cases, then a study-published corrected p below 0.05, both strictly. The
    owner's draft gave the rule as "a row whose study-published corrected p is
    below 0.05", which is the second half alone: a depleted row, or a
    synonymous one, clears that and survives nothing.

    **0.05 is the atlas's, and the page renders it from `concordance.ALPHA`**
    (review, 2026-10-27). It read "at the 0.05 the studies themselves use",
    which is false of a raw p: PMID:42230622's block tells a reader to judge
    raw p against its whole scan. The literal below pins the published number
    and the assertion beside it pins the rule's, so a change to either fails
    here until the other is reconsidered.

    **It names how wide a survival is** (owner decision 2026-10-26, R3): a
    correction over a gene panel is not a genome-wide one, and the card says
    which, beside the q. PMID:40127276's per-arm q is Benjamini-Hochberg over
    its 248 panel genes, reproduced from Dataset S6 on every arm; the card
    pins on TBX5 are in `test_built_site_is_consumable.py`.

    """The expression reading notes, moved off every gene page (2026-10-26, D50).

    Six paragraphs, pinned whole. The first is the bulk-dilution notice in
    full: a gene page keeps one line of it (`pages._BULK_TISSUE_NOTICE`,
    one of the ten caveats the spec keeps visible) and links here. The next
    two were the page's folded "How to read these figures" notes. The next
    two define tau and the developmental phases, which 118 and 119 gene pages
    print and nothing on the site defined until review (2026-10-26; each
    clause's source is recorded in `methods._EXPRESSION`). The last states in
    general the axes each chart's visible caption line states of its own
    figure (D57), and is where the charts' "How to read this chart" toggles
    link.

    Each was re-read for a page with no gene, dataset or figure on it, and
    reworded where its words assumed one: "below", "shown below", "on this
    page" and "elsewhere on this page" name nothing here. Read against the
    code and a build of 0fc451a (`methods._EXPRESSION` records each):

    * the bulk claim is scoped to *developmental* expression, the profile
      datasets the gene page's section renders, and held to every curated
      dataset by
      `test_every_curated_dataset_is_the_bulk_tissue_the_expression_notes_say`;
    * "the number of genes measured" is the number the grid was built from
      (`Placement.n_genes`: 58,735 in every cell of E-MTAB-6814's grid);
    * "a dataset's own detection floor" read as the source's, and the only
      floor in the corpus is this atlas's curated choice
      (`floor_source: "Curated, not mirrored"`). "its dataset's" read the same
      way, so since review (2026-10-26) the paragraph says whose a floor is
      and where `datasets.json` gives its value and basis, and the bulk
      paragraph says "the detection floor"; the dataset that sentence names is
      held to its record by
      `test_the_dataset_the_floor_sentence_names_declares_no_threshold_of_its_own`;
    * the reference distribution changes shape "over development", not "as
      the heart matures": every organ's grid moves -- liver's 90th percentile
      is 24 tpm at 4 wpc and 5 at adolescence, heart's 28 and 6;
    * the small multiples share one axis *within a dataset*
      (`_small_multiples` fits one per dataset block), and a trajectory follows
      one cardiac organ, its axis fitted to the gene's placed medians there;
    * tau's 0 and 1 are the formula's bounds, and no value between is glossed:
      D39(c) keeps every adjective about a tau off the site;
    * the phases' source is named in the form the trajectory's key renders
      `attributed_to`, and a stage matches a phase on `start <= wpc < end`.

    Pinned whole rather than paragraph by paragraph, for the reason
    `#rare-variants` is: a `findall` over `<p>` skips an appended `<p class=...>`
    or `<details>`.
