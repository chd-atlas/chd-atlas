"""The Orphanet frequency rule, on a synthetic ontology small enough to read.

Each test below exists to kill one way the rule could quietly admit the wrong
syndrome. Measured on the real data before the rule was written (spec
2026-10-24): applied without the structural restriction, the same floor admits
Fabry disease and Hurler syndrome through their cardiomyopathy and valve
findings, so the restriction is the part most worth pinning.

    stenosis *is* counted, as a tetralogy). So widening or narrowing the rule
