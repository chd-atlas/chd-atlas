    """The green pill tracks the classification, not merely the fact of one.

        `chip-definitive` is the top of the stylesheet's grade ramp and the only
        class filled with the full success colour, so keying it on
        `headline_confidence is not None` would paint a refuted gene green while its
        own label read "refuted" -- the display failure `vocab.strongest` is
        documented against. Since 2026-08-06 the class comes from
        `render.GRADE_CHIP_KIND`, keyed on the grade's own value, and `refuted` maps
        to `warn`: the assertion below is that the rail's chip is the caution colour,
        not merely that it is not green.

        **The slice is the rail, not the page.** `render.grade_legend` rendered one
        chip of every class -- including `chip-definitive` -- inside a `<details>` on
        every page, so a page-wide `not in` could never fail again and passed only
        because the legend did not exist when it was written. CLAUDE.md section 4.19
        is this exact shape: a page-wide assertion is not a section assertion. The
        legend left the gene page for `methods.html#scope` on 2026-10-26 (D50); the
        slice stays, because the rail is still the element under test.

        Parametrised over the two warning flags in opposite states because they are
        separate axes: `has_conflicting_evidence` is any mixed evidence,
        `has_source_discordance` is specifically ClinGen and GenCC disagreeing with
        each other. Each case is the unique killer of dropping one of the two chips
        -- measured 2026-08-04 by replacing each `if` with `if False:` in `_rail`:
        dropping "sources disagree" failed only the second case, dropping
        "conflicting evidence" only the first, and nothing else in this file
        noticed either. The `hidden` assertion is what catches the two flags being
        read into the wrong chip.

    No published gene carries a contested headline -- the floor excludes those
        rungs and the ClinGen veto excludes the rest -- so the refuted chip is
        latent, reachable only from a fixture. The two flags are not: both are set
        on six published genes since the Orphanet scope path (BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1,
        PTPN11, RAF1, SOS1; this read "neither flag is set on any of the 92
        genes" until 2026-10-26).

        **Each chip is asserted whole, title included (2026-10-26).** `sources
        disagree` had no title and `methods.html` never mentioned it, while on
        all six pages carrying it ClinGen and GenCC agree on every gene-disease
        pair they both classify: the flag is per gene, and fires on a dispute for
        one disease beside support for another. The title says so.

        **The gene index carries the same `conflicting evidence` chip, keyed on
        the same flag.** Its confidence column showed those six genes as a bare
        `definitive` until 2026-10-26, the settled reading `docs/data-api.md`
        forbids a client. Asserted on the gene's own row, beside the bare grade
        the confidence facet still matches on; the second case is the row that
        must not carry it.

      better than half of all runs, which §4.12 records as not being a guard.
    * the nine-member `lesion` facet below -- **0/200**, and **0/1000**.

    The pooling caveat's wording became the spec's approved short form on
    2026-10-26 ("count the same children twice", D50, P7), and "children"
    became "people" the same day (a shared collection may be a control cohort
    of adults); the rule -- visible outside every fold -- is unchanged. The
    scan-size assertion is pinned to the method line's own words since the
    same day: the card's no-correction line also carries "138,609" ("judge its
    results against its scan of 138,609 tests"), so the bare number would pass
    with the method line folded away.

    **Two chart caveats joined the list on the owner's decision of 2026-10-26
    (E1)**, each particular to its figure and each folded under "How to read
    this chart" until then: a forest panel's warning that a `union`-tagged
    row is not fully split (10 panels on 10 pages, measured on a build of
    3b766ba), and the trajectory's note that its ticks are stages below the
    detection floor (32 of 112 trajectories). Each is required outside every
    fold, once, where it fires -- the `all cases` row below has its syndromic
    half drawn and no non-syndromic one, and the heart series has a stage
    below the floor -- and absent from the whole page where it does not, so a
    clause moved back into the toggle fails the first half and one rendered
    unconditionally fails the second.

    rare-variant section -- the synonymous paragraph on the 113 of them with a
    synonymous row -- and are now on `methods.html#rare-variants`, where

    screen below, and carrying it ran a cell to 61 characters and set the column
    width for the whole grid.

    **The measure is not negotiable.** `_effect`'s rule is that no branch omits
    it, because an odds ratio of 3.1 and a de novo enrichment of 3.1 are
    different claims and a bare `3.1` equates them. A mutation matrix on
    2026-08-05 found that dropping it from the compact form survived the entire
    suite, which is the only reason this test exists.

    **An unbounded effect keeps its lower bound** (2026-10-26). It rendered a
    bare `OR ∞`, and on TBX5's and ZEB2's cells "OR ∞" over "p 0.0316" stood for
    an interval of 0.786–∞ that spans 1, visible only on hover -- the reading
    `_effect` already refuses, "infinitely enriched" with the bound that
    contradicts it out of sight. The bare form is left only where there is no
    bound to keep. Asserted on the cell's visible text, sliced from its `title`,
    which carries the interval wherever the row has one.

    **The bound is formatted, and TBX5's cannot show it**: 0.786 prints the same
    raw as at three significant figures, so printing `ci_low` unformatted
    survived the full suite (review, 2026-10-26). ZFPM1's non-syndromic
    missense row, 3.5212, is a real published bound whose two forms differ.

    Measured 2026-08-20 on the built corpus: 288 rows carry the tag, **0 of
    them with neither component on the panel** -- so the tag itself is never
    false -- but on 10 panels a tagged row has only one of its two components
    drawn. TBX5's Audain odds-ratio panel is one: `all cases · loss-of-
    function` is tagged and the key says "`all cases` is the syndromic and
    non-syndromic rows together", while the panel carries `syndromic · loss-
    of-function` and no non-syndromic one. All 10 are a cell the study
    published no row for at all -- a missing (stratum, consequence) cell is
    not a null result -- so the row below the union is part of it, not all of
    it, and the key said otherwise.

    The tag stays: `all cases · loss-of-function` really does contain the
    syndromic row beneath it, and dropping the tag would publish the two as
    independent findings, which is the defect the tag exists to prevent. It
    is the key's reconciliation instruction that has to become conditional.

    Three panels, because the corpus can only show one of the two axes: all
    10 measured cases split on the **stratum** axis, so a fixture built from
    the corpus alone would leave the consequence branch unmeasured.

    **The visible line names the row and what is missing from it** (review,
    2026-10-27). It said "at least one of the rows it contains is not
    plotted; the table below carries every row this study published for this
    gene", pointing a reader at the table for a row that is in no table: on
    all 10 published panels the missing component is a cell the study never
    published for the gene. A fourth panel separates the two things an
    absence can be -- a component the study published and the panel cannot
    draw (no effect to place) is "not plotted here", never "published no" --
    which no published panel shows today, so the fixture is its only
    measurement. Each sentence is pinned as a literal on its panel's visible
    line.

    `_forest_caption` made the measure label dynamic and then hardcoded the

    the 137 panels, across 88 gene pages, read "Axis: **OR** ... the vertical
    line is **1**, no enrichment" -- and for an odds ratio 1 is *no
    association*. "No enrichment" is the de-novo-against-expectation
    vocabulary that belongs to the 25 `enrichment_ratio` panels. That is the
    conflation `effect_measure` exists to prevent (`_effect`'s docstring: an
    odds ratio of 3.1 and an enrichment of 3.1 are different claims), stated
    in the sentence whose whole job is telling the reader how to read the
    axis. The sibling `<title>` on the same figure already varied correctly.

    Each gloss is pinned against a **literal**, never against
    `_NULL_LINE_GLOSS`, per CLAUDE.md section 4.38: asserting the constant
    would pass for any rewording including a reintroduction of the single
    hardcoded gloss. `rate_ratio` is in `EffectMeasure` and carries 0 rows
    today; it is parametrised so the third vocabulary is written before a
    study needs it rather than after. The fourth case is an unrecognised
    token, which must still be glossed -- `_effect` has no branch that omits
    its label and this has none that omits its gloss -- with a phrase true of
    any ratio rather than one borrowed from a vocabulary the token may not
    belong to.

    Scoped to the `<figure class="forest">` and then to the axis sentence
    inside it (section 4.19): "no enrichment" also appears in this section's

    (the measure, its range, and what 1 means for that measure) stays in sight
    and every other clause folds but one. Most of them describe a mark in
    words that are the same wherever that mark is drawn; the not-fully-split
    clause does not -- it warns about this panel. It folded too, as the D57
    spec placed it (10 panels on 10 pages, measured 2026-10-26), and the owner
    moved it to the visible line the same day (E1). **Each clause
    keeps its condition**: the tests above that assert a clause renders only
    beside its mark slice the figure, which contains the toggle, so they hold
    unchanged; this one asserts where the clauses sit.

    One panel that draws every mark, so every conditional clause renders: a
    surviving composite (filled), an arrow to the right (unbounded, its
    correction failed: hollow), an arrow to the left (an effect of zero), a
    stratum union whose non-syndromic half is absent (the not-fully-split
    warning), and a synonymous row with no interval (hatched and muted).

    Both halves are pinned whole, as literals, so a clause that leaves the
    fold, drops out or changes fails here. That pins two clauses nothing
    pinned before (inventory finding 1) -- the left arrow and the muted row --
    and the muted clause changed on the fold: it ended "How to read these
    results says why", a link to the same section the toggle now closes on,
    so it names the row's role itself ("its negative control").

    **Two more changes after review (2026-10-26).** The muted clause was
    singular -- "The muted row is this study's synonymous row" -- while each of
    the 113 panels carrying it draws three, one per case group; it says "one
    of this study's synonymous rows". And the toggle's link read "How to read

    sentences stay visible -- stage order rather than elapsed time, and a
    vertical axis fitted to this gene, with its range -- because they say what
    every point on the figure is. The floor, tick and no-row clauses and the
    shaded phases fold under "How to read this chart", which ends on a link to
    `methods.html#expression`, where the axes are stated once in general. The
    link reads "How to read expression figures", not the nav's "How to read
    this atlas", for the reason the forest's toggle names its section.
    **Each clause keeps its condition**: the tests above that assert a clause
    renders only beside its mark read the whole section, or the caption
    through `_band_caption_text`, which takes the toggle, so they hold
    unchanged; this one asserts where the clauses sit.

    The fixture is the one that earns every clause the floor allows at once: a
    below-floor stage between two placed ones (the floor clause) and a stage
    with no heart row (the no-row clause).

    **The floor clause is on the visible line since the owner's decision of
    2026-10-26 (E1)**, in a short form, because it is particular to this gene;
    `test_every_particular_caveat_survives_outside_the_fold` requires it there
    where it fires and nowhere where it does not. The no-row clause stays
    folded, and its first spelling reads "different" rather than "different
    again": the clause it contrasts with is now the line above the toggle, not
    the sentence before it in the same paragraph.

    Pinned whole, both halves, as literals.

    carry a below-floor stage strictly between two plotted points, and TBX1
    has 11 of them against 5 placed stages. A single line through the placed
    points runs smooth and high across exactly the stages where this dataset
    measured below its own floor -- the picture asserting a continuity the
    figures deny.

    all three mutants that test could kill are killed here too, so it was
    paying for a build without being the unique killer of anything. Its
    rationale is the record and moves with it -- *below the floor*, *not
    sampled* and *zero* are three different claims: plotting a below-floor
    stage at zero puts it on the axis as the lowest measurement this atlas
    made, and leaving a gap makes it indistinguishable from a stage nobody
    sampled. The counts are asserted rather than the class name alone,
    because a renderer that ticked every stage, or that ticked the
    below-floor stage *and* plotted it, satisfies a bare `in` check.

    **And `_FLOOR_GAP` is what keeps the tick off the lowest real point.**
    That constant's whole stated purpose is to stop the atlas's weakest
    statement about a figure -- "we do not vouch for this one" -- landing on
    the same pixel row as its lowest real one. Nothing guarded it: the lowest
    placed point always sits at exactly `_PLOT_BOTTOM - _FLOOR_GAP`, so

# under PYTHONHASHSEED 0 and 12345, and mutating them one at a time was killed
# by 0 of the 1,050 tests that existed at 38fb290, the commit before this
# section.

) -> None:
    """D56: one line per (study, analysis) with a surviving row, never a ranking.

    The line shows the first surviving row in the table's own reading order
    (`burden._sort_key`: stratum, then the `damaging` union before its parts),
    never the most significant one -- the atlas authors no ranking -- then how
    many more in that group survive. Counts in their own unit through `_count`,
    and a de novo row against its expectation through `_controls`.

    The fixture is built so each rule has something to get wrong. Rows arrive
    in reverse study order and with the de novo arm before the case-control
    arm, so the groups must be sorted, not iterated as met. Within each group
    the later-ordered row arrives first (`lof` before `damaging`,
    `nonsyndromic` before `syndromic`), so the first row must come from the
    sort, and the CNV group's first survivor is a stratum other than `all`,
    which the line must name. Two rows that do not survive sit in surviving
    groups (corrected 0.536; corrected 0.2) and one study publishes no
    correction at all, so a row that is merely nominal must never reach a line.

    **Each line ends with a link to its study's block**, `#study-<PMID digits>`
    on that study's `<h3>`, labelled `caveats` where any of the group's
    *surviving* rows carries a `method_note` and `details` otherwise -- the
    note is where a caveat about those counts reaches a reader (PMID:34324492's
    cases include 777 thoracic aortic aneurysm probands). The CNV group's note
    is on its second survivor, not its first, so the label reads the whole
    group; the case-control group's note is on its one row that does not
    survive, so the label reads only survivors; and its first survivor's note
    is whitespace, which is no note. Every study block carries exactly one
    anchor, including the study with no line.

    **The rest of a group's survivors are named, not counted** ("also
    surviving: loss-of-function; missense (damaging)"), in the same reading
    order: "2 more survive" beside the `damaging` union counted its own two
    components as further findings. Each label carries its stratum and lesion
    group where they are not the whole cohort, so a per-lesion row is never
    shown unlabelled. A line from a study by an atlas author says so, as the
    study's block does; each link's accessible name names its study (WCAG
    2.4.9). And PMID:42230622, which publishes no corrected p for this gene,
    gets its own line saying so, with the scan size its block judges it by --
    never a threshold the atlas computed (D12/D33).

    thoracic aortic aneurysm probands, and a carrier there is anyone with a
    rare deletion overlapping the gene. A count that reaches the card must not
    shed what qualifies it on the way.

    The cell named the most significant row in it -- corrected p where

    in PMID:40127276 is `nominal` because its missense row is (p 0.0468, q
    0.270), and it named the `damaging` union (p 0.0613, q 0.200) under the
    "enriched nominally" glyph: a row that is not nominally significant at all.
    1 of 109 enriched cells on a real build. The fixture is GJA1's three rows.

    The second case is the same defect under the `corrected` glyph: a
    supporting row whose study published no correction sorts on its raw p, and
    1.2e-5 sorts before the survivor's q of 0.00944. It names the survivor.
    Both read `concordance.deciding_rows`, which `family_state` reads its tier
    from, so the glyph and the named row cannot come apart again.

    **Among rows that all decide, the corrected p ranks them, not the raw one.**
    The third case is RAF1's de novo cell: its `damaging` row has the lower q
    (9.13e-05 against 1.45e-04) and its missense row the lower raw p (1.17e-06
    against 3.68e-06), so a sort on raw p alone names the other row. Measured
    on a real build (review, 2026-10-26): that mutant changes the named row in
    8 of 109 enriched cells, and survived the full suite until this case.

    """Counted in cohort families, never in studies, and only those that tested it.

    PMID:42230622 and PMID:34324492 share a sample collection here (`ddd`), so
    three studies are two independent datasets; a third family that tested
    nothing for this gene is passed in and must not be counted. No row
    survives: one is nominal in a study publishing no correction, one fails its
    correction (0.2), and one is the synonymous negative control clearing a
    correction (0.001), which is not support. The power caveat stays: it is the
    sentence that stops "none survives" reading as evidence against the gene.

    **"None survives" may only speak of corrections a study published.**
    PMID:42230622 publishes no corrected p on any row, and the card read "none
    survives its own study's correction" for SMAD4 -- whose block tells the
    reader to judge raw p against the study's scan of 138,609 tests, which two
    SMAD4 rows (p 1.6e-08, 2.47e-10) would clear. Measured 2026-10-26: 24
    published genes are tested by that study alone. So the closing sentence
    says "a correction its study published", and each study that published
    none for this gene gets a line saying so, naming its scan size where
    `Publication.tests_reported` records it and inventing none where it does
    not. Whether a study published a correction is decided per gene, from its
    rows: any `pvalue_adjusted`. Where no study that tested the gene published
    one, the closing sentence says only how many tested it: "none survives a
    correction its study published" would be vacuously true there, and read as
    a correction applied and failed.

    **The closing sentence declares a study by an atlas author** (owner
    decision 2026-10-26, R7): it names no study, so MYH11's card, tested by
    PMID:34324492 alone, carried no declaration at all. Three forms, each
    pinned: one study, all of several, some of several -- counted in studies,
    not datasets, which the two-studies-one-family case is here to tell apart.
    A study by no atlas author adds nothing.

    **The count carries the front page's qualifier** (owner answer
    2026-10-27): "(as far as the cohort registry records)", straight after
    the count and before any declaration, in every form here -- singular and
    plural, with each declaration and with none. Pinned as literals, never as
    the constant that renders it.

    Known Disease Relationship` counts for nobody. `Supportive` does count --
    Orphanet asserts without grading.

    **Inheritance is the mode of the records that carry the warrant**: the
    ClinGen records at the headline grade, or the admitting submitters' records
    at or above the floor. Not every record's: the NKX2-5 fixture holds an
    `X-linked` record below its headline and an `Autosomal recessive` GenCC one,
    and neither is the mode of the classification the chip shows.

    **Every mode at the headline, not the first.** ROBO1, PRKD1 and LZTR1 each
    carry two ClinGen records at their headline grade for one disease, one
    `AD` and one `AR` (measured 2026-10-26), so the admitting record alone
    would state half of what the panel graded. All six of ClinGen's codes here,
    sorted by the words a reader sees. Six, not five, because the modes are
    de-duplicated through a `set`: probed as the six labels under
    `PYTHONHASHSEED` 0..499, one process each, the set iterated in sorted order
    on 0 of 500 seeds; the same five without `Unknown` did so on 2 of 300, a
    dropped sort surviving about one run in 150 (CLAUDE.md section 4.42).

    `Refuted` *and* some record supports the gene. A line saying only that
    "an authority" disputes the gene told a reader neither who nor for what;
    PTPN11 is Definitive for Noonan syndrome and Disputed by the same panel for
    Costello and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, beside a Definitive gloss
    reading "no convincing evidence to the contrary". So the line names them:
    each authority's own term, verbatim, the diseases it applies it to, and
    the authority -- the panel for a ClinGen record, the submitter for a GenCC
    one. Panels first, then submitters, each by name. It names exactly the
    contested records the validity table lists: ClinGen's own GenCC copy of a
    panel record folds there (`_repeats_the_panel`) and is not named twice.
    The fixture lists cardiofaciocutaneous before Costello, so "Costello
    syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome" can only come from the sort;

    """PTPN11 is Definitive for Noonan syndrome, in a CHD atlas (D55).

    Since 2026-10-25 a syndrome can be in scope because Orphanet records a
    structural heart malformation in at least 30% of its cases. The validity
    section's notes say so at length; the card says it in one line beside the
    chip, because the chip is what a reader reads first -- and says *why* it
    is in scope, which "Graded for Noonan syndrome, not for heart disease"
    (the wording until 2026-10-26) left a reader to guess. Several diseases
    join with "and", never "; ", which the warrant row above already uses
    between diseases.

    **A subtype's warrant is its syndrome's.** Orphanet records the heart
    malformation for Adams-Oliver syndrome, and Adams-Oliver syndrome 4 (EOGT's
    headline disease, the one subtype among the 21 Orphanet lines measured
    2026-10-26) is in scope as its subtype; "in at least 30% of cases" alone
    would read as a frequency recorded for the subtype itself. **And still
    named beside a direct one**: a headline graded for Noonan syndrome and for
    Adams-Oliver syndrome 4 names both syndromes. Attributing only when every
    warrant is a subtype's would drop "of Adams-Oliver syndrome" there, and
    that mutant survived the release review's 634-test mutation run until this
    case was added (2026-10-26; latent, none of the 21 lines on a real build
    that day).

    **Rendered only when every disease the headline grade is for is
    Orphanet-scoped**, and naming all of them. A gene graded at its headline
    for a syndrome *and* for a disease an authority curated as CHD would read
    "not for heart disease" while it is -- latent today (0 of 98 graded genes,
    measured 2026-10-26), and pinned so it stays a sentence nobody can publish.
    PTPN11 is graded Definitive for two Orphanet-scoped syndromes, and a line
    naming one would state half of what the warrant row above it names.

    **A syndrome a ClinGen panel scoped gets the line too** (owner decision
    2026-10-26, R5), read off the curated `syndrome` mark: Holt-Oram is marked,
    and "congenital heart disease with heterotaxy syndrome" (ZIC3, NODAL) is not
    -- it is CHD itself, whatever its name says. Every headline disease must be
    marked and ClinGen-scoped, as every one must be Orphanet-scoped above: a
    marked syndrome beside an unmarked CHD term gets nothing, and a marked
    term a GenCC submitter scoped has no panel to name. It says the syndrome is
    in scope *on* the panel's curation, not *because* the panel curates it: the
    Syndromic Disorders panel curates 176 disease terms, 3 of them in scope.

      word for word, so the three cannot describe the gate differently.
      **Scoped to the list, not to a property of a disease**: it read "for a
      disease an external authority treats as congenital heart disease, or
      in which Orphanet records a structural heart malformation in at least
      30% of cases" until 2026-10-26, false on FLNA's card -- ClinGen grades
      FLNA Definitive for periventricular nodular heterotopia, which would
      qualify through Orphanet and which no curator has nominated. That
      clause is asserted absent from the whole page, so it cannot return on
      another line of the card or in the validity section either;
    * not curated with functional records (latent: 0 genes today) -- the
      sentence names the lesion assertion as what is absent, because "not
      curated by the atlas" beside "the atlas has curated 1 functional record"
      denies the atlas's own work in the sentence that counts it.

    "Not *yet* curated", because the state is `not_yet_curated`: the atlas has
    not decided against curating these genes.

    The discriminator between the two uncurated sentences is `validity_state`,
    not the headline: a gene admitted on agreement that ClinGen recorded `No
    Known Disease Relationship` for in scope has a panel record, and the first
    sentence stays true of it where the second would not. That gene is a case
    here, because it is the only one that tells the two apart: every other
    fixture pairs a panel record with a headline, and keying the sentence on
    the headline survived all 1,297 tests until it was added (2026-10-26). Its
    page carries "no ClinGen expert panel has graded" nowhere.

    Exactly one curation paragraph per card, and none in the main column: the
    sentence moved here, and a page stating it twice is a page whose two copies
    can come to disagree.

    **The card ends on two links, after this sentence (P1, 2026-10-26):** "How
    to read this page", to the top of `methods.html`, and the gene's own JSON.
    The nav links the same file as "How to read this atlas"; the card's text
    differs on purpose, because from the card the reader's question is about
    the page in front of them. Every section a gene page renders has a section
    there, except the atlas's own curated evidence and its publications, which
    render on 1 of 119 pages (measured 2026-10-26). The link is to the top, not
    an anchor: the card abbreviates the scope, validity and rare-variant
    sections at once.
