# tests/test_docs_match_the_build.py
"""Pin the consumer documentation against what the build actually publishes.

`docs/data-api.md` opens by claiming every example is copied from a real build
rather than written by hand. Nothing checked that, and it drifted: the
`genes/index.json` example lost `conflicting_lesion_groups` — the field
`schema_version` 1.1 was minted for, and the one the document's own closing
section calls "the one consumer obligation this API imposes".

The consequence was not a missing line. A consumer typing their browse row off
an exhaustive, alphabetically-ordered example ships without the per-group
contested flag, and for a gene that is definitive-and-refuted on septal disease
while merely moderate on conotruncal, what they render inverts the science: the
definitive call reads as the solid one when it is precisely the disputed one.

So this is not a style check. It is the same guarantee the dead-link sweep gives
the payloads, applied to the document a consumer builds against.

    Values rather than key sets, unlike the shape test above, and deliberately:
    the `manifest.json` block is the one example in this document whose numbers a
    reader takes as a *census of the atlas* rather than as an illustration. It
    said `"publications": 1` for a corpus holding 4 — true when it was written,
    false for three releases after — and nothing could see it, because a wrong
    census stays internally consistent (CLAUDE.md section 4.24).

    `schema_version` is pinned here as well as in `test_build_manifest.py`. That
    file compares the published value against a literal; this one checks the
    *document* names the same version, which is the claim a consumer branches on
    after reading it. A release that bumps the constant and not the prose leaves
    the two disagreeing with nothing to notice.

    Checksums and the commit stay placeholders and are not asserted: both change
    with every commit, so pinning them would guarantee this document is wrong by
    the next one.

    **Parsed, not substring-matched, and the difference is not cosmetic.** The
    first version of this test asserted `f'"{key}": {value}' in section`, which

    `290`, the needle `"burden_rows": 29` is a substring of `"burden_rows": 290`
    and the test passes. Any documented figure having the build's figure as a
    prefix slips through — exactly the stale-census failure this guard exists to
    catch. Found by review 2026-08-06. `_example` already parses the fenced

    `datasets.json` is serialised generically from the curated record, so
