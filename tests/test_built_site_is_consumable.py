    `Emitter.checksums` records what was written, never what a payload promised.

    `literature.py` is what writes them, with nothing tying the two together —

    is how a loop over an empty collection reports success. They are floors
    rather than exact counts so that curating more data strengthens this test

    no gene carries omics summaries and no variant shard exists in the committed

    changing that one argument to `None` passed all 1,053 tests while changing

    detection floor at every stage sampled* in whole heart (19 stages
    sampled)" — including HGNC:10249, whose own bundle places 18 of those 19
    heart stages against the percentile grid with the percentiles printed in
    the table directly below. A false claim, on 30 pages, in bold, under a
    green build. This repository's characteristic defect exactly.

    Three assertions, because the wiring can fail in three ways and only the
    first is the mutant above:

    * bands are drawn at all — `phases=None` publishes zero;
    * every label drawn is one a curator wrote in
      `curation/cardiac_phases.yaml` — a renderer inventing its own phase
      names would satisfy the first;
    * the phases banded are **exactly** those whose window a sampled stage
      falls inside — not a subset, not a superset. This is the only check that
      the renderer and `CardiacPhaseFile.phases_for` agree over the real
      corpus rather than over a fixture, and unlike a subset assertion it
      catches a band that should be drawn and is not.

    **The third assertion used to be "the one phase whose end the source never
    states is banded nowhere", and it retired on 2026-08-24 rather than being
    quietly rewritten.** `heart_looping` was that phase; it now carries a
    `derived` end from GO:0001947's own definition, so **no curated phase is
    unended** and the assertion had nothing left to range over. It failed
    loudly rather than passing vacuously, because whoever wrote it put
    `assert unended, "the third assertion below is vacuous"` above it — and
    that guard is the only reason this is a paragraph rather than a dead check
    nobody noticed. The rule itself is unchanged and still tested, at the layer
    where a fixture can build the state the real pipeline no longer produces:
    `test_build_pages.py::test_a_phase_the_source_never_ended_bands_nothing`.
    What is genuinely lost is real-pipeline confirmation of that rule, and it
    is lost because the corpus stopped containing an instance — not because
    anyone judged it less important.

    """D55/D56 against every real page: the card and the bundle cannot disagree.

    A gene's card lists a surviving rare-variant result iff its bundle's
    `independent_datasets.corrected` is above zero -- both read
    `concordance.survives_own_correction`, and this is what fails if a runner
    or a renderer stops agreeing with it on real data rather than on a
    fixture. Lines are counted inside the card's rare-variant block only, not
    the whole rail. A card listing none says why: the none-survives sentence
    where the bundle has burden rows, the no-study sentence where it has none.

    **No card may say a result failed a correction its study never made.**
    PMID:42230622 publishes no corrected p on any row, and SMAD4's card read
    "none survives its own study's correction" of it, while its block judged
    two of its rows against a scan that they clear. So every study that tested
    the gene and published no correction for it is named on its own line, and
    exactly those; the old sentence appears on no card. A study by an atlas
    author carries the declaration on every card line that names it.

    **A study's summary caveat follows its card lines**: once per study with a
    line on the card, in study-id order, with exactly the text
    `publications.json` publishes for it, and on no card without a line from
    that study -- so PMID:34324492's thoracic aortic aneurysm probands reach
    every card that shows its counts. The gene index, whose strips summarise
    every study's result for every gene, prints each caveat exactly once.

    And every card states once what the atlas itself curated, nothing in the
    main column repeats it, a card names who disputes the gene exactly where
    the bundle's `has_conflicting_evidence` is true, and every card ends on one
    link to `methods.html` and one to the gene's own JSON.

    Counts derived, never pinned. Both sides of each "iff" must be exercised,
    or the test is measuring one population twice (CLAUDE.md section 4.30).

    Two figures over every `genes/HGNC_*.html` of the real build, each at most a
    constant set from a measurement, and both over **prose, not data**: the
    visible blocks outside every table and definition cell (`_CELLS`). (a) The
    median of the words visible on load per page; (b) the boilerplate, the
    visible sentences of six words or more that are identical on at least 90%
    of gene pages, each counted once however many pages carry it.

    **(a) counted cells until review (2026-10-26), and so measured data.** The
    burden, validity and stage tables a page shows are rows of mirrored data,
    and a curation-only change failed the suite: one more GenCC row for USP44
    (HGNC:20064), the median page at 957, moved the median to 958 -- and the
    deploy workflow runs this test. Re-run on a `git archive` copy of the
    branch with the row added (`SGC-999001`, PanelApp Australia, `Limited`
    for MONDO:0005453): (a) is 841 with and without it, this test passes on
    it, and USP44's own page falls from 862 to 844, because the sentence
    saying no other submitter is mirrored gives way to a table.

    The 2f6300a row is the owner's wording decisions of 2026-10-26 (E1, E2, R4,
    R6, R7), measured on a build of the clean tree at each commit: 3b766ba
    read 841 and 21 / 395, as at 802d694. E1 lifted two particular caveats
    out of the chart folds (+12, to 853); E2 dropped "whole" (-2, to 851); R4's
    matrix caption sentence is on all 118 pages with a matrix (+38, to 889) and
    is the 22nd boilerplate sentence (38 words); R7's declaration on the
    card's tested line is on 86 cards (+6, to 895). R6's line is on one card
    and E3's section intro on one page, and neither moves either figure; R10,
    W2, W4 and W5 change no gene page's visible prose (W4's and W5's cohort
    descriptions render folded). Growth from owner-decided sentences is deliberate (E4), and
    none of them was folded or cut to fit.

    The row after it is the review of those decisions (2026-10-27), measured
    on a fresh build of the clean tree at that commit against one of ad03128
    (895, 1,016, 22 / 432, as at 2f6300a). R4's caption now renders only where
    the card lists a surviving row, so it left 86 pages (-38 each) and the
    boilerplate (-1 sentence, -38 words); the own-lab declaration's corrected
    wording is 10 words longer in each own-lab block (+10 or +20 on 118 pages,
    +10 boilerplate words). Per page: -28 on 27, -18 on 40, +16 on 16, and
    smaller moves elsewhere; the median fell by 13. Both constants were lowered
    to the new measurement, not left at their old headroom.

    The last row is the second batch of owner decisions (R1, R3, R5, R8, R9,
    R11, R13, I3; 2026-10-26/27), measured on fresh builds of the clean tree
    after each item against one of e0393f4 (882, 1,001, 21 / 404, as at
    9a8f14d). Two items moved the figures, both owner-decided sentences (E4):
    R5's card line naming the ClinGen panel that scoped a syndrome, on 10
    cards (+4, to 886); and I3, which merged PMID:34324492 and PMID:42230622
    into one cohort family -- both legends gained the clause saying a family
    also merges across collections recorded as overlapping, 11 words on the
    118 matrix legends (+11, to 897; boilerplate words 404 to 415, still 21
    sentences), and its notice naming the declared DDD-DECIPHER overlap is 45
    words on the 72 pages carrying both studies (+45, to 942; 897 is the
    median of the same build with that notice's words subtracted). R1, R3,
    R8, R9, R11 and R13 moved neither figure: R3's 35 card lines sit on 25
    pages, below the median's reach, and R8 changes only hrefs. The notice is
    particular to the page's data, so the fold rule keeps it visible; (a) was
    raised to 971, 942 x 1.03 rounded up, and (b) stays 22, one over 21.

    "cells" is the history: (a) with cells counted, the figure this test
    asserted until review, 957 at zero headroom. (b) never counted them, and
    the review's fixes to methods.html left every gene page's bytes as at
    802d694. The card's last line, "How to read this page · this gene as
    JSON", is one of the 21: nine words, on every page. The plan's baseline
    read 1,460 on cb326ca with the inventory's parser, which reads `<br>` as a
    space; under that reading the cells column is 4 higher on each build
    (1,460, 1,198, 956 and 961) and no other figure moves, since every `<br>`
    on a gene page sits in a table cell.

    **Headroom, because a curation-only change must not fail the suite.**
    (a) is held at 971, the last row's 942 x 1.03 rounded up, and (b) at 22,
    one more than 21 (owner decision E4 keeps both margins; they were 909 and
    22 over 9a8f14d's row, 922 and 23 over 2f6300a's, and 867 and 22 over
    802d694's). **When this fails,
    re-measure before anything else.** If the growth is a new study's or
    dataset's own data-driven prose, raise the budget and put the measurement
    here. Never fold a caveat the fold rule
    requires visible to get under it: the budget exists to keep explanation
    off the page, not to take a warning out of sight.

    **Proved able to fail** (2026-10-26, each a build of a `git archive` copy
    of the branch, measured with this parser): the full scope rule
    (`methods.SCOPE_RULE`) rendered after the short form on every gene page
    reads 1,144 and 27 sentences, over both budgets; the grade key back on the
    page 986 and 27; the short form replaced by the full rule 1,112 and 25;
    the trajectory's toggle unfolded 889 and 22; the small multiples' 948 and
    24. Two now pass, and each is killed by a test of its own: the
    rare-variant reading notes re-added under a fold, 846 and 21 (a summary
    line is all that shows), and the pooling notice's long form, 863 and 22.
    That is the cost of headroom, and why this test is a ceiling on growth
    rather than a pin on any one sentence.

    The first assertions check the instrument on input this test writes, so
    a broken parser, word count, sentence split or share cannot pass the
    budget on any pages: with `_WORD` matching nothing every page reads 0
    words, and the short form replaced by the full scope rule passed this
    test (review, 2026-10-26). The real pages' median must also be positive.
